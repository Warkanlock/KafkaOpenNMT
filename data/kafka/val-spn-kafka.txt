Alguien debe haber estado diciendo mentiras sobre Josef K él sabía que él tenía
no hizo nada malo pero una mañana fue arrestado Todos los días en
A las ocho de la mañana la señora Grubachs le trajo el desayuno
La señora Grubach era su cocinera pero hoy ella no vino
Nunca había ocurrido antes de que K esperara un poco miró desde su
almohada en la anciana que vivía enfrente y que lo miraba con
una curiosidad bastante inusual para ella y finalmente tanto hambre como
desconcertado sonó el timbre Inmediatamente llamaron a la puerta
y un hombre entró Nunca antes había visto al hombre en esta casa
Era delgado pero estaba firmemente construido Su ropa era negra y ajustada
con muchos pliegues y bolsillos hebillas y botones y un cinturón todos
Lo que daba la impresión de ser muy práctico pero sin hacerlo
muy claro lo que eran en realidad para quién eres? pregunto K
sentado medio erguido en su cama El hombre sin embargo ignoró la pregunta
como si su llegada simplemente tuviera que ser aceptada y simplemente te respondiera
¿sonó? Anna debería haberme traído mi desayuno dijo K trató de
averiguar quién era el hombre en primer lugar en silencio solo a través de
observación y pensando en ello pero el hombre no se quedó quieto a
ser mirado por mucho tiempo En su lugar se dirigió a la puerta abierta
ligeramente y le dijo a alguien que estaba claramente de pie inmediatamente
Detrás de él quiere que Anna le traiga su desayuno Había un
La risa en la habitación vecina no estaba clara desde el
El sonido de si había varias personas riendo El hombre extraño
No podría haber aprendido nada de eso que él no hubiera conocido ya
Pero ahora le dijo a K como si estuviera haciendo su informe No es posible
Sería la primera vez que sucediera eso dijo K cuando saltó
de la cama y rápidamente se puso el pantalón quiero ver quién es ese
en la habitación de al lado y por qué es que la señora Grubach me ha dejado estar
perturbado de esta manera Inmediatamente se le ocurrió que no necesitaba
han dicho esto en voz alta y que debe tener hasta cierto punto
reconoció su autoridad al hacerlo pero eso no parecía importante
para él en el momento en que al menos así es como el extraño lo tomó como él
¿No crees que es mejor que te quedes donde estás? quiero
ni para quedarse aquí ni para ser hablado por usted hasta que haya presentado
usted mismo lo quise decir por su propio bien dijo el extraño y abrió
La puerta esta vez sin que se le pregunte La siguiente habitación que K
Entró más lentamente de lo que había previsto miró a primera vista exactamente
Lo mismo que la noche anterior Vivía la Sra Grubachs
Sala llena de muebles manteles de porcelana y
Fotografías Tal vez haya un poco más de espacio de lo habitual
hoy pero de ser así no fue inmediatamente obvio especialmente porque la principal
diferencia fue la presencia de un hombre sentado junto a la ventana abierta con una
Libro desde el que ahora miró Deberías haberte quedado en tu habitación
¿Franz no te lo dijo? ¿Y qué es lo que quieres entonces? dijo K
mirando hacia adelante y hacia atrás entre este nuevo conocido y el que está nombrado
Franz que se había quedado en la puerta a través de la ventana abierta
Noté a la anciana otra vez que se había acercado a la ventana opuesta
para que ella pudiera seguir viendo todo lo que mostraba
curiosidad que realmente lo hizo parecer como si fuera senil I
Quiero ver a la Sra Grubach dijo K haciendo un movimiento como si estuviera rasgando
se alejó de los dos hombres aunque estaban bien alejados
de él  y quería irse No dijo el hombre en la ventana que
arrojó su libro sobre una mesa de café y se levantó No puedes irte
cuando estás bajo arresto Eso es lo que parece dijo K y por qué estoy
Estoy bajo arresto? Luego preguntó: "Algo no estaba permitido"
Dile que entre en su habitación y espere allí Los procedimientos están en marcha
y aprenderás sobre todo a su debido tiempo No es realmente
parte de mi trabajo para ser amable contigo como este pero espero que nadie
Aparte de Franz se enterará y será más amable
hacia ti de lo que él debería haber estado bajo las reglas si tú
sigue teniendo tanta suerte como has estado con tu arresto
oficiales entonces se puede contar con las cosas que van bien contigo K quería
para sentarse pero luego vio que aparte de la silla junto a la ventana
No había ningún lugar en la habitación donde pudiera sentarse
la oportunidad de ver por ti mismo cómo es cierto todo esto se dice Franz y
ambos hombres luego caminaron hacia K Eran significativamente más grandes que él
Especialmente el segundo hombre que lo abofeteaba frecuentemente en el hombro
Los dos sintieron la camisa de dormir de Ks y dijeron que ahora tendría que usar
uno que era de una calidad mucho menor pero que mantendrían el
camisa de noche junto con sus otras ropas interiores y devolverlas a él si
Su caso resultó bien Es mejor para ti si nos das el
Cosas que si las dejas en el almacén decían cosas
Tendremos una tendencia a desaparecer en el almacén y después de un cierto
la cantidad de tiempo que venden las cosas si el caso involucrado ha llegado
para terminar o no Y casos como este pueden durar mucho tiempo especialmente
Los que han estado viniendo últimamente te dieron el dinero
Lo consiguieron para ellos pero no sería mucho ya que no es lo que son
ofrecido para ellos cuando los venden lo que cuenta es cuánto obtienen
resbaló en el lado y cosas por el estilo pierden su valor de todos modos cuando
se transmiten de mano en mano año tras año K paga apenas
cualquier atención a lo que decían no le daba mucho valor
lo que pudo haber poseído o sobre quién decidió qué sucedió
Para ellos era mucho más importante obtener una comprensión clara de
su posición pero no podía pensar claramente mientras estas personas estaban
Aquí la segunda panza de policías y solo podían ser policías
Parecía lo suficientemente amigable sobresaliendo hacia él pero cuando K levantó la vista
y vio su cara de hueso seco que no parecía encajar con el cuerpo de Su
nariz fuerte torcida hacia un lado como si ignorara K y compartiera una
entendiendo con el otro policía ¿Qué clase de personas eran estas?
¿De qué estaban hablando? ¿A qué oficina pertenecían? K fue
vivir en un país libre después de todo en todas partes estaba en paz todas las leyes
eran decentes y se mantuvo quién fue el que se atrevió a abordarlo en su propio
¿casa? Siempre estuvo dispuesto a tomar la vida tan a la ligera como pudo
cruzar puentes cuando vino a ellos no les preste atención ni siquiera al futuro
cuando todo parecía amenazado pero aquí no parecía el
cosa correcta que hacer Él podría haberlo tomado todo como una broma una gran broma
por sus colegas en el banco por alguna razón desconocida o también
Tal vez porque hoy era su trigésimo cumpleaños todo era posible de
Por supuesto tal vez todo lo que tenía que hacer era reírse en la cara de la policía en algún
camino y se reirían con él tal vez eran comerciantes de la
En la esquina de la calle parecían estar pero él estaba
No obstante determinado desde la primera vez que vio el
Llamó a Franz para no perder ninguna ligera ventaja que podría haber tenido sobre
estas personas Había un riesgo muy pequeño de que la gente dijera más tarde
no podía entender una broma pero aunque normalmente no estaba en el
hábito de aprender de la experiencia  él también podría haber tenido algunos
Ocasiones sin importancia en mente cuando a diferencia de sus amigos más cautos él
había actuado sin pensar en absoluto por lo que podría seguir y se había hecho
sufrir por ello No quería que eso volviera a suceder no esta vez en
menos; Si estuvieran actuando actuaría junto con ellos
        Todavía tenía tiempo Permítame dijo y se apresuró entre la
Dos policías a través de su habitación Parece lo suficientemente sensato como él
Los escuchó decir detrás de él Una vez en su habitación rápidamente abrió el
cajón de su escritorio todo estaba muy ordenado pero en su
agitación no pudo encontrar los documentos de identificación que estaba
Buscando de inmediato finalmente encontró su permiso de bicicleta y fue
a punto de volver con los policías cuando le parecía demasiado
mezquino por lo que siguió buscando hasta que encontró su certificado de nacimiento
Justo cuando regresaba a la habitación contigua la puerta del otro lado
abrió y la Sra Grubach estaba a punto de entrar Él solo la vio por una
un instante tan pronto como reconoció a K estaba claramente avergonzada
pidió perdón y desapareció cerrando la puerta detrás de ella muy
con cuidado venga K podría haber dicho en ese momento pero ahora se puso de pie
en medio de la habitación con sus papeles en la mano y todavía mirando
En la puerta que no se abrió de nuevo se quedó así hasta que estuvo
sobresaltado por el grito del policía que estaba sentado en la pequeña
mesa en la ventana abierta y como K ahora vio estaba comiendo su desayuno
¿Por qué no entró ella? le preguntó a Shes que no le permitieran decir el
gran policía usted está bajo arresto no está usted pero ¿cómo puedo ser?
¿bajo arresto? ¿Y por qué es así? Ahora estas empezando
otra vez dijo el policía sumergiendo un pedazo de pan con mantequilla en el
honeypot No contestamos preguntas como esa Tendrás que
responda dijo K Aquí están mis papeles de identificación ahora muéstrame
Lo tuyo y yo ciertamente queremos ver la orden de detención Oh Dios mío
dijo el policía en una posición como la tuya y crees que puedes
Empieza a dar órdenes ¿verdad? No te servirá de nada ponernos en el
lado equivocado incluso si usted cree que lo hará  probablemente haya más de su lado
que alguien más que conoces Eso es cierto que tú sabes mejor
Creo que Franz sostiene una taza de café en su mano que él
No se levantó a la boca sino que miró a K de una manera que probablemente era
destinado a estar lleno de significado pero en realidad no se pudo entender K
Se encontró sin intención de hacerlo en un diálogo mudo con Franz pero
luego golpeó su mano en sus papeles y dijo: Aquí está mi identidad
documentos y que quieres que hagamos al respecto respondió el grande
policía ruidosamente la forma en que lo llevas es peor que un
niño que es lo que quieres ¿Quieres conseguir este gran juicio sangriento?
tuyo con rapidez hablando de identificación y órdenes de arresto con
¿nosotros? Solo somos policías eso es todo lo que somos oficiales subalternos como nosotros
Casi no sé un extremo de una tarjeta de identificación de otro todo lo que tenemos que ver con
Es mantenerte vigilado durante diez horas al día y recibir un pago por ello
Eso es todo lo que tenemos en mente Lo que podemos hacer es asegurarnos de que
Los funcionarios para los que trabajamos descubren qué tipo de persona es Theyre
va a arrestar y por qué debería ser arrestado antes de que emitan el
garantiza que no hay error allí Nuestras autoridades que yo sepa
y solo sé que los grados más bajos no salen a buscar la culpa entre
el público; Es la culpa la que los atrae como dice la ley
y ellos tienen que enviarnos agentes de policía Eso es la ley donde
¿Crees que hay algún error allí? No se esta ley
dijo K tanto peor para ti entonces dijo el policía Es
Probablemente existe solo en sus cabezas dijo K que quería de alguna manera para
insinuar su camino en los pensamientos de los policías para remodelar esos
Pensamientos para su beneficio o para estar en casa allí Pero el
El policía acaba de decir con desdén Youll averiguará cuándo te afecta
Franz se unió y dijo: Mira esto Willem él admite que no
conoce la ley y al mismo tiempo insiste en que es inocente eres bastante
bien pero no podemos hacer que entienda una cosa dijo el otro K
dejó de hablar con ellos; ¿Pensó para sí mismo realmente tengo
para seguir enredado con el parloteo de los funcionarios de la base
¿Me gusta esto?  Y se admiten que son de lo más bajo
posición Theyre hablando de cosas de las que no tienen la
La más mínima comprensión de todos modos es solo por su estupidez
que sean capaces de estar tan seguros de sí mismos solo necesito algunas palabras
con alguien de la misma posición social que yo y todo lo hará
ser incomparablemente más claro mucho más claro que una larga conversación con
Estos dos pueden hacerlo Caminó arriba y abajo del espacio libre en la habitación
un par de veces al otro lado de la calle pudo ver a la anciana que
ahora había tirado a un anciano mucho mayor que ella hasta la ventana
y tenía sus brazos alrededor de él K tuvo que poner fin a esta pantalla
Llévame a tu superior dijo Tan pronto como él quiere verte
No antes dijo el policía el llamado Willem y ahora mi
Un consejo para usted agregó es entrar en su habitación mantener la calma y esperar
y vea qué hacer con usted Si sigue nuestros consejos no lo hará
cansarse de pensar en cosas sin ningún propósito que necesite tirar
Ustedes juntos hay muchas cosas que se requieren de ustedes
No te has comportado con nosotros como nos merecemos después de ser tan buenos
te olvidas de que lo que somos somos hombres libres y
No lo eres y eso es toda una ventaja Pero a pesar de todo eso
todavía estaban dispuestos si tienes el dinero para ir a buscarte
Desayuno de la cafetería en la carretera
        Sin dar ninguna respuesta a esta oferta K se detuvo para algunos
Tal vez si abriera la puerta de la habitación contigua o incluso la del frente
puerta los dos no se atreverían a interponerse en su camino tal vez eso
sería la forma más sencilla de resolver todo esto llevándolo a una
cabeza Pero tal vez lo agarrarían y si lo arrojaban sobre la
terreno que perdería toda la ventaja que tenía en un cierto sentido
sobre ellos así que decidió en la solución más segura la forma en que las cosas
Iría en el curso natural de los acontecimientos y regresaría a su habitación
Sin otra palabra ni de él ni de los policías
        Se arrojó sobre su cama y del tocador se levantó
tomó la linda manzana que había puesto allí la noche anterior para su
desayuno Ahora era todo el desayuno que tenía y de todos modos como él
confirmado tan pronto como tomó su primer gran mordisco estaba lejos
mejor que un desayuno que podría haber tenido a través de la buena voluntad del
Policías de la cafetería sucia Se sentía bien y confiado en que tenía
No pude ir al trabajo en el banco esta mañana pero eso podría ser fácilmente
excusado debido a la posición relativamente alta que mantuvo allí Debería
¿De verdad le envías su explicación? Se preguntaba si nadie
Le creía y en este caso sería comprensible que pudiera
traer a la señora Grubach como testigo o incluso a la pareja de al otro lado del
calle que probablemente incluso ahora estaban en camino a la ventana
opuesto Desconcertó a K al menos le desconcertó mirándolo desde el
punto de vista de los policías que lo habían hecho entrar en la habitación y
Lo dejó solo allí donde tenía diez formas diferentes de matar
él mismo al mismo tiempo aunque se preguntó esta vez mirando
desde su propio punto de vista qué razón podría tener para hacerlo
Porque esos dos estaban sentados allí en la habitación de al lado y habían tomado su
desayuno tal vez? Habría sido tan inútil suicidarse
que incluso si hubiera querido la inutilidad lo habría hecho
tal vez si los policías no hubieran sido tan obviamente limitados en
sus capacidades mentales se podría haber supuesto que habían venido
a la misma conclusión y no vio ningún peligro en dejarlo solo debido a
Podrían verlo ahora si quisieran y ver cómo se fue a
el armario en la pared donde guardaba una botella de buenos licores cómo
Primero vació un vaso de él en lugar de su desayuno y cómo él entonces
Tomó un segundo vaso para dar valor al último
Solo como precaución por la improbable posibilidad de que sea necesaria
        Entonces se sobresaltó tanto con un grito que le gritó desde la otra habitación que
Se golpeó los dientes contra el cristal El supervisor quiere ver
Dijo una voz Fue solo el grito lo que lo sobresaltó tan bruscamente
Un grito militar brusco que no habría esperado de la
El policía llamó a Franz En sí mismo el pedido fue muy bien recibido
Por fin volvió a llamar con llave al armario y sin demora
Se apresuraron a la siguiente habitación Los dos policías estaban parados allí y
Lo persiguió de regreso a su habitación como si eso fuera una cuestión de curso
¿Qué piensas que estás haciendo? ellos gritaron pensar que vas a ver
El supervisor vestido solo con tu camisa ¿verdad? Él se encargará de ti
tengo un golpe justo y nosotros y todos déjame ir por el amor de Dios
Llamé a K que ya había sido empujado hacia atrás hasta su guardarropa si
Me acercas cuando todavía estoy en la cama no puedes esperar encontrarme en mi
vestido de noche que no te ayudará dijeron los policías que siempre
Se quedó muy callado casi triste cuando K comenzó a gritar y de esa manera
Lo confundió o hasta cierto punto lo trajo a sus sentidos ridículo
se quejó de las formalidades mientras levantaba su abrigo de la silla y seguía
en sus dos manos por un rato como si lo sostuviera para el
Inspección de la policía Sacudieron la cabeza Tiene que ser una
Abrigo negro dijeron En eso K tiró el abrigo al suelo y
dijo  sin saber siquiera a sí mismo lo que quería decir con él  bueno no es
El juicio principal va a ser después de todo los policías se rieron pero
continuó insistiendo que tiene que ser un abrigo negro Bueno eso es
bien por mí si hace que las cosas vayan más rápido dijo K Abrió el
El vestuario mismo pasó mucho tiempo buscando entre toda la ropa
y eligió su mejor traje negro que tenía una chaqueta corta que tenía mucho
Sorprendió a los que lo conocieron entonces también sacó una camisa fresca y
comenzó a vestirse cuidadosamente Se dijo secretamente que tenía
Logró acelerar las cosas dejando que los policías se olviden de hacer
Él se bañó Los miró para ver si podían recordar después
Todos pero por supuesto nunca se les ocurrió aunque Willem no lo hizo
olvide enviar a Franz al supervisor con el mensaje diciendo que
K se estaba vistiendo
        Una vez que estuvo vestido adecuadamente K tuvo que pasar por Willem mientras iba
a través de la siguiente habitación en la que está más allá de la puerta de la cual ya estaba
K bien abierta sabía muy bien que esta habitación había sido recientemente alquilada a un
mecanógrafa llamada Miss Bürstner Tenía la costumbre de salir a
trabajo muy temprano y regresando a casa muy tarde y K nunca había
Intercambiaron más de unas pocas palabras de saludo con ella Ahora su cama
La mesa había sido colocada en el centro de la habitación para ser utilizada como escritorio
para estos procedimientos y el supervisor se sentó detrás de él tenía su
Las piernas se cruzaron y arrojaron un brazo sobre el respaldo de la silla
        En una esquina de la sala había tres jóvenes mirando
Las fotografías pertenecientes a la señorita Bürstner que habían sido puestas en un
Pedazo de tela en la pared Colgado en el asa de la ventana abierta
Era una blusa blanca En la ventana de enfrente había el viejo
par de nuevo aunque ahora su número había aumentado como detrás de ellos y
mucho más altos de lo que estaban parados un hombre con una camisa abierta que mostraba
su pecho y una barba de perilla rojiza que apretó y torció con
sus dedos josef k? pidió al supervisor tal vez simplemente para
atrajo la atención de K mientras miraba alrededor de la habitación K asintió
Me atrevo a decir que te sorprendió bastante todo lo que está sucediendo esto
La mañana dijo que el supervisor como con ambas manos apartó el
Algunos artículos en la mesita de noche: la vela y la caja de un libro
y un cojín que estaba allí como si fueran cosas que él necesitaría
Para su propio negocio sin duda dijo K y comenzó a sentir
relajado ahora que al fin se paró frente a alguien con algún sentido
Alguien con quien pudiera hablar de su situación
Ciertamente estoy sorprendido pero de ninguna manera estoy muy sorprendido
¿No estás muy sorprendido? preguntó el supervisor mientras posicionaba el
Vela en el medio de la mesa y las otras cosas en un grupo alrededor
Quizá no me entiendas del todo K señaló apresuradamente
Lo que quiero decir es que aquí K interrumpió lo que estaba diciendo y miró
ronda por algún lugar para sentarme puedo sentarme ¿no? preguntó
Eso no es habitual el supervisor respondió Lo que quiero decir se dice
K sin demorar una segunda vez que sí estoy muy sorprendido pero
Cuando llevas treinta años en el mundo y tienes que hacer
a su manera a través de todo lo que ha sido mi suerte entonces
Te endureces a las sorpresas y no te las tomas demasiado duro
Especialmente no qué ha pasado hoy Por qué especialmente no qué
pasado hoy? No quisiera decir que veo todo esto como un
En broma parece que te has tomado demasiadas molestias para hacer todo esto
Los arreglos para que todos en la casa deben participar en ella
así como todos ustedes que irían más allá de lo que podría ser una broma
Así que no quiero decir que esto es una broma Muy bien dijo el
Supervisor mirando para ver cuántos partidos quedaron en la caja Pero
por otro lado K siguió mirando a todos allí e incluso
deseando poder llamar la atención de los tres que estaban mirando el
fotografías por otro lado esto realmente no puede ser todo lo que
importante que se desprende del hecho de que he sido acusado pero
No puedo pensar en la menor ofensa por la que podría ser acusado
Pero incluso eso es todo lo que está al lado la pregunta principal es: ¿Quién es
emitiendo la acusación? ¿Qué oficina está llevando a cabo este asunto? Eres tú
funcionarios? Ninguno de ustedes está usando un uniforme a menos que usted es
llevando  aquí se volvió hacia Franz  está destinado a ser un uniforme
En realidad es más un traje de viaje Necesito una respuesta clara a
Todas estas preguntas y estoy bastante seguro de que una vez que se han hecho las cosas
claro que podemos despedirnos en el mejor de los términos El
supervisor golpeó la caja de fósforos sobre la mesa que está haciendo
un gran error dijo Estos caballeros y yo no tenemos nada que hacer
con su negocio de hecho no sabemos casi nada de usted Podríamos
Use uniformes tan apropiados y exactos como desee y de su situación
no sería peor para ti En cuanto a si estás en un cargo I
No puedo darte ningún tipo de respuesta clara a la que ni siquiera sé
Ya sea que estés o no bajo arresto tienes toda la razón
eso pero no sé más que eso Tal vez estos oficiales tienen
He estado charlando contigo bien si tienen eso es todo lo que es Chit
Chat No puedo darte una respuesta a tus preguntas pero puedo darte
Un consejo: mejor piense menos en nosotros y en lo que va a hacer
te pasa y piensa un poco más sobre ti mismo y deja de hacer todo
este alboroto sobre tu sentido de inocencia; no haces tan mal
impresión pero con todo este alboroto lo estás dañando y deberías
hablar un poco menos demasiado Casi todo lo que has dicho hasta ahora tiene
han sido cosas que podríamos haber tomado de su comportamiento incluso si dijera
no más que unas pocas palabras y lo que has dicho no ha sido exactamente
a tu favor
        K se quedó mirando al supervisor Era este hombre probablemente más joven que
¿Le estaba dando clases como un maestro de escuela? ¿Estaba siendo castigado por
¿Su honestidad con un alarido? ¿Y no iba a aprender nada sobre el
¿Razones de su arresto o de los que lo estaban arrestando? Se convirtió en
Un tanto cruzado y comenzó a caminar arriba y abajo Nadie lo detuvo haciendo
Esto y se echó las mangas hacia atrás sintió que su pecho se enderezaba
el pelo pasó a los tres hombres dijo: No tiene sentido en el que
Estos tres se dieron vuelta para enfrentarlo y se acercaron a él con seriedad
expresiones Finalmente se detuvo de nuevo frente a la
Supervisor de escritorio el fiscal estatal Hasterer es un buen amigo mío
dijo que puedo telefonearlo? Ciertamente dijo el supervisor pero
No sé de qué se trata supongo que debes tenerlo
Algún asunto privado que quieras discutir con él ¿De qué se trata?
Gritó K más desconcertado que la cruz ¿Quién te crees que eres?
Desea ver algún punto en él mientras realiza algo como
inútil como podría ser? Es suficiente para hacerte llorar Estos caballeros
Primero acércate a mí y ahora se sientan o se paran aquí y me dejan estar
arrastrado frente a usted ¿Qué punto habría en telefonear a un
¿Abogado estatal cuando aparentemente estoy bajo arresto? Muy bien no lo haré
realizar la llamada telefónica Puede llamarlo si quiere decir el
supervisor extendiendo su mano hacia la habitación exterior donde el
el teléfono era por favor sigue haciendo tu llamada No no lo hago
Quiero más dijo K y se acercó a la ventana A través de la
calle la gente todavía estaba allí en la ventana y era sólo ahora
que K había subido a su ventana porque parecían inquietarse
acerca de ver en silencio lo que estaba pasando La vieja pareja quería conseguir
arriba pero el hombre detrás de ellos los calmó Tenemos un tipo de
La audiencia de allí llamó a K al supervisor bastante alto mientras él
señaló con su dedo índice Go Go y luego llamó a través de
ellos y los tres se retiraron inmediatamente unos pasos
pareja de edad incluso se encontraron detrás del hombre que luego los ocultó
Con la amplitud de su cuerpo y parecía ir por los movimientos de su cuerpo
Boca estar diciendo algo incomprensible en la distancia
Sin embargo no desapareció por completo sino que parecía estar esperando el
Momento en que pudieron volver a la ventana sin ser notados
Personas intrépidas e intrusivas dijeron K mientras se volvía a la
habitación El supervisor puede haber estado de acuerdo con él al menos K pensó que
fue lo que vio por el rabillo del ojo pero fue lo más posible
que ni siquiera había estado escuchando ya que tenía su mano presionada firmemente
abajo sobre la mesa y parecía estar comparando la longitud de sus dedos
Los dos policías estaban sentados en un cofre cubierto con un
manta frotándose las rodillas los tres jóvenes habían puesto sus
manos en sus caderas y miraban alrededor sin rumbo Todo estaba
Todavía como en alguna oficina que ha sido olvidada ahora
los caballeros llamaron a K y por un momento pareció como si estuviera
cargando a todos en sus hombros parece que su negocio con
En mi opinión es mejor ahora dejar de preguntarme
Si está procediendo correcta o incorrectamente y para llevar el
Si se trata de un
misma opinión entonces por favor y se acercó a la mesa de supervisores
y le tendió la mano El supervisor levantó los ojos mordió la suya
Labio y miró la mano extendida de Ks; K todavía creía en el
el supervisor haría lo que él sugirió pero en lugar de eso se levantó recogido
Se puso un sombrero redondo que estaba sobre la cama de la señorita Bürstners y se lo puso
con cuidado sobre su cabeza usando ambas manos como si se probara un nuevo sombrero
Todo te parece tan simple no le dijo a K como lo hizo
así que crees que deberíamos llevar el asunto a un cierre pacífico
No no eso no lo haré Cuidado por otro lado sin duda
No quiero que pienses que no hay esperanza para ti No ¿por qué deberías hacerlo?
¿piensa eso? Simplemente estás bajo arresto nada más que eso
Lo que tuve que decirte es lo que he hecho y ahora he visto cómo
Lo has tomado Es suficiente para un día y podemos despedirnos
entre sí por el momento al menos espero que quiera entrar
¿Al banco ahora no vas al banco? pregunté K pensé que
estaba bajo arresto K dijo esto con cierta cantidad de desafío como
aunque su apretón de manos no había sido aceptado se sentía más
independiente de todas estas personas especialmente desde que el supervisor tenía
Se puso de pie Estaba jugando con ellos Si se iban había decidido que
correría tras ellos y les ofrecería arrestarlo Por eso
incluso repetido ¿Cómo puedo ingresar al banco cuando estoy bajo arresto? yo
veo que me has malinterpretado dijo el supervisor que ya estaba en el
puerta Es cierto que estás bajo arresto pero eso no debería detenerte
de llevar a cabo tu trabajo y no debería haber nada que te detenga
continuar con su vida habitual En ese caso no está tan mal
estar bajo arresto dijo K y se acercó al supervisor I
Nunca quiso decir que debería ser algo más respondió Apenas parece
haber sido necesario para notificarme de la detención en ese caso dijo K
y se acercaron aún más Los otros también se habían acercado Todos ellos tenían
reunidos en un espacio estrecho junto a la puerta que era mi deber
dijo el supervisor Un deber tonto dijo K inquebrantable Tal vez sea así
Respondió el supervisor pero no perdamos el tiempo hablando como
esto había asumido que estarías queriendo ir al banco ya que estás
prestando mucha atención a cada palabra añadiré esto: no te estoy forzando
para ir al banco Id solo asumí que querías Y para hacer cosas
Más fácil para usted y para que pueda llegar al banco con el menor problema
posible he puesto a estos tres caballeros colegas tuyos en tu
disposición ¿Qué es eso? exclamó K y miró a los tres en
asombro solo recordaba haberlos visto en su grupo por el
fotografías pero estos jóvenes anémicos sin carácter eran de hecho
funcionarios de su banco no colegas suyos que lo pusieron también
alta y mostró una brecha en la omnisciencia del supervisor pero
No obstante eran miembros menores del personal del banco ¿Cómo podría tener K
¿No pudiste ver eso? ¿Cuán ocupado debe haber estado con el supervisor?
y los policías no han reconocido estos tres Rabensteiner
con su actitud rígida y sus manos oscilantes Kullich con su rubia
cabello y ojos hundidos y Kaminer con su sonrisa involuntaria causada por
espasmos musculares crónicos Buenos días dijo K después de un tiempo extendiéndose
Su mano a los caballeros ya que se inclinaron correctamente a él no lo hice
Te reconocemos en absoluto Tan bien ve al trabajo ¿vale? los
Los caballeros se rieron y asintieron con entusiasmo como si eso fuera lo que
había estado esperando todo el tiempo excepto que K había dejado su sombrero en
su habitación así que todos se lanzaron uno tras otro a la habitación para buscar
lo que causó una cierta vergüenza K se situó donde él
fue y los miró a través de la puerta doble abierta el último para ir de
Por supuesto fue el apático Rabensteiner que se había roto en no más de
un elegante trote Kaminer llegó al sombrero y K como a menudo tenía que hacer
en el banco se recordó a la fuerza que la sonrisa no fue deliberada
que de hecho no pudo sonreír deliberadamente En ese momento la Sra
Grubach abrió la puerta desde el pasillo hacia la sala donde todos
Las personas eran Ella no parecía sentirse culpable por nada en absoluto
y K tan a menudo antes miró hacia abajo en el cinturón de su delantal que para
No hay razón para cortar tan profundamente en su cuerpo fuerte Una vez abajo K con
su reloj en su mano decidió tomar un taxi ya había sido
retrasado por media hora y no hubo necesidad de hacer ningún retraso
Kaminer ya corrió a la esquina para convocarlo y los otros dos estaban
haciendo esfuerzos obvios para mantener a K desviado cuando Kullich señaló la
puerta de la casa en el otro lado de la calle donde el hombre grande
con la barba rubia de la perilla apareció y un poco avergonzado al principio
en dejarse ver en toda su altura retrocedió hasta la pared
and leant against it  The old couple were probably still on the stairs
K was cross with Kullich for pointing out this man whom he had already
seen himself in fact whom he had been expecting Dont look at him
he snapped without noticing how odd it was to speak to free men in this
way  But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi
arrived they sat inside and set off  Inside the taxi K remembered
that he had not noticed the supervisor and the policemen leaving  the
supervisor had stopped him noticing the three bank staff and now the
three bank staff had stopped him noticing the supervisor  This showed
that K was not very attentive and he resolved to watch himself more
carefully in this respect  Nonetheless he gave it no thought as he
twisted himself round and leant over onto the rear shelf of the car to
catch sight of the supervisor and the policemen if he could  But he
turned back round straight away and leant comfortably into the corner of
the taxi without even having made the effort to see anyone  Although it
did not seem like it now was just the time when he needed some
encouragement but the gentlemen seemed tired just then Rabensteiner
looked out of the car to the right Kullich to the left and only Kaminer
was there with his grin at Ks service  It would have been inhumane to
make fun of that
        That spring whenever possible K usually spent his evenings
after work  he usually stayed in the office until nine oclock  with a
short walk either by himself or in the company of some of the bank
officials and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the
regulars table with mostly older men until eleven  There were
however also exceptions to this habit times for instance when K was
invited by the banks manager (whom he greatly respected for his
industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to
eat dinner with him at his large house  K would also go once a week
to see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through
the night until late in the morning  During the daytime she only
received visitors while still in bed
        That evening though  the day had passed quickly with a lot of
hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings  K
wanted to go straight home  Each time he had any small break from the
days work he considered without knowing exactly what he had in mind
that Mrs Grubachs flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by
the events of that morning and that it was up to him to put it back
into order  Once order had been restored every trace of those events
would have been erased and everything would take its previous course
once more  In particular there was nothing to fear from the three bank
officials they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and
there was no alteration to be seen in them  K had called each of them
separately or all together into his office that day for no other reason
than to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able
to let them go again
        At half past nine that evening when he arrived back in front of
the building where he lived he met a young lad in the doorway who was
standing there his legs apart and smoking a pipe  Who are you?
immediately asked K bringing his face close to the lads as it was
hard to see in the half light of the landing  Im the landlords son
sir answered the lad taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to
one side  The landlords son? asked K and impatiently knocked on
the ground with his stick  Did you want anything sir?  Would you like
me to fetch my father?  No no said K there was something
forgiving in his voice as if the boy had harmed him in some way and he
was excusing him  Its alright he said then and went on but before
going up the stairs he turned round once more
        He could have gone directly to his room but as he wanted to speak
with Mrs Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked  She was sat
at the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in
front of her  K apologised a little embarrassed at coming so late
but Mrs Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology
she was always ready to speak to him he knew very well that he was her
best and her favourite tenant  K looked round the room it looked
exactly as it usually did the breakfast dishes which had been on the
table by the window that morning had already been cleared away  A
womans hands will do many things when noones looking he thought he
might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly
would not have been able to carry it all out  He looked at Mrs Grubach
with some gratitude  Why are you working so late? he asked  They
were now both sitting at the table and K now and then sank his hands
into the pile of stockings  Theres a lot of work to do she said
during the day I belong to the tenants; if Im to sort out my own
things there are only the evenings left to me  I fear I may have
caused you some exceptional work today  How do you mean Mr K? ella
asked becoming more interested and leaving her work in her lap  I
mean the men who were here this morning  Oh I see she said and
went peacefully back to what she was doing that was no trouble not
especially  K looked on in silence as she took up the knitted
stocking once more  She seems surprised at my mentioning it he
thought she seems to think its improper for me to mention it  All the
more important for me to do so  An old woman is the only person I can
speak about it with  But it must have caused some work for you he
said then but it wont happen again No it cant happen again she
agreed and smiled at K in a way that was almost pained  Do you mean
that seriously? asked K  Yes she said more gently but the
important thing is you mustnt take it too hard  There are so many
awful things happening in the world  As youre being so honest with me
Mr K I can admit to you that I listened to a little of what was going
on from behind the door and that those two policemen told me one or two
things as well  Its all to do with your happiness and thats
something thats quite close to my heart perhaps more than it should be
as I am after all only your landlady Anyway so I heard one or two
things but I cant really say that its about anything very serious
No  You have been arrested but its not in the same way as when they
arrest a thief  If youre arrested in the same way as a thief then
its bad but an arrest like this    It seems to me that its
something very complicated  forgive me if Im saying something stupid 
something very complicated that I dont understand but something that
you dont really need to understand anyway
        Theres nothing stupid about what youve said Mrs Grubach or
at least I partly agree with you only the way I judge the whole thing
is harsher than yours and think its not only not something complicated
but simply a fuss about nothing  I was just caught unawares thats
what happened  If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting
myself get confused because Anna wasnt there if Id got up and paid no
regard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you
if Id done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an
exception asked you to bring my clothes from my room in short if I
had behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened everything
that was waiting to happen would have been stifled  People are so often
unprepared  In the bank for example I am well prepared nothing of
this sort could possibly happen to me there I have my own assistant
there there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of
me on the desk I continually receive visits from people
representatives officials but besides that and most importantly Im
always occupied with my work thats to say Im always alert it would
even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that
sort  But now its over with and I didnt really even want to talk
about it any more only I wanted to hear what you as a sensible woman
thought about it all and Im very glad to hear that were in agreement
But now you must give me your hand an agreement of this sort needs to
be confirmed with a handshake
        Will she shake hands with me?  The supervisor didnt shake hands
he thought and looked at the woman differently from before examining
her  She stood up as he had also stood up and was a little self
conscious she hadnt been able to understand everything that K
said  As a result of this self consciousness she said something that
she certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate  Dont
take it so hard Mr K she said with tears in her voice and also of
course forgetting the handshake  I didnt know I was taking it hard
said K feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree
with him it was of very little value
        Before going out the door he asked Is Miss Bürstner home?
No said Mrs Grubach smiling as she gave this simple piece of
information saying something sensible at last  Shes at the theatre
Did you want to see her?  Should I give her a message?  I er I just
wanted to have a few words with her  Im afraid I dont know when
shes coming in; she usually gets back late when shes been to the
theatre  It really doesnt matter said K his head hanging as he
turned to the door to leave I just wanted to give her my apology for
taking over her room today  Theres no need for that Mr K youre
too conscientious the young lady doesnt know anything about it she
hasnt been home since early this morning and everythings been tidied
up again you can see for yourself  And she opened the door to Miss
Bürstners room  Thank you Ill take your word for it said K but
went nonetheless over to the open door  The moon shone quietly into the
unlit room  As far as could be seen everything was indeed in its
place not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle  The
pillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the
moonlight  Miss Bürstner often comes home late said K looking at
Mrs Grubach as if that were her responsibility  Thats how young
people are said Mrs Grubach to excuse herself  Of course of
course said K but it can be taken too far  Yes it can be said
Mrs Grubach youre so right Mr K  Perhaps it is in this case  I
certainly wouldnt want to say anything nasty about Miss Bürstner she
is a good sweet girl friendly tidy punctual works hard I
appreciate all that very much but one thing is true she ought to have
more pride be a bit less forthcoming  Twice this month already in the
street over the way Ive seen her with a different gentleman  I really
dont like saying this youre the only one Ive said this to Mr K I
swear to God but Im going to have no choice but to have a few words
with Miss Bürstner about it myself  And its not the only thing about
her that Im worried about  Mrs Grubach you are on quite the wrong
track said K so angry that he was hardly able to hide it and you
have moreover misunderstood what I was saying about Miss Bürstner that
is not what I meant  In fact I warn you quite directly not to say
anything to her you are quite mistaken I know Miss Bürstner very well
and there is no truth at all in what you say  And whats more perhaps
Im going to far I dont want to get in your way say to her whatever
you see fit  Good night  Mr K said Mrs Grubach as if asking him
for something and hurrying to his door which he had already opened I
dont want to speak to Miss Bürstner at all not yet of course Ill
continue to keep an eye on her but youre the only one Ive told what I
know  And it is after all something that everyone who lets rooms has
to do if shes to keep the house decent thats all Im trying to do
Decent called out K through the crack in the door if you want to
keep the house decent youll first have to give me notice  Then he
slammed the door shut there was a gentle knocking to which he paid no
mas atencion
        He did not feel at all like going to bed so he decided to stay
up and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss
Bürstner would arrive home  Perhaps it would also still be possible
even if a little inappropriate to have a few words with her  As he lay
there by the window pressing his hands to his tired eyes he even
thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs Grubach by persuading
Miss Bürstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would  But
he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive and
there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of
the incidents of that morning  Nothing would have been more nonsensical
and above all more pointless and contemptible
        When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he
slightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone
who entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch  He
lay there quietly smoking a cigar until about eleven oclock  He
wasnt able to hold out longer than that and went a little way into the
hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Bürstner arrive sooner  He
had no particular desire for her he could not even remember what she
looked like but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that
her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and
disorder right to its very end  It was also her fault that he had not
had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa as
he had intended  He could still make up for both of those things
though if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked  He wanted to do
so even later after the discussion with Miss Bürstner
        It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard
in the stairway  K who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway
walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room fled behind his
door  Miss Bürstner had arrived  Shivering she pulled a silk shawl
over her slender shoulders as she locked the door  The next moment she
would certainly go into her room where K ought not to intrude in the
middle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now but
unfortunately he had not put the electric light on in his room so that
when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an
attack and would certainly at the very least have been quite alarming
There was no time to lose and in his helplessness he whispered through
the crack of the door Miss Bürstner  It sounded like he was pleading
with her not calling to her  Is there someone there? asked Miss
Bürstner looking round with her eyes wide open  Its me said K and
came out  Oh Mr K said Miss Bürstner with a smile Good
Evening and offered him her hand  I wanted to have a word with you
if you would allow me?  Now? asked Miss Bürstner does it have to be
now? It is a little odd isnt it?  Ive been waiting for you since
nine oclock  Well I was at the theatre I didnt know anything
about you waiting for me  The reason I need to speak to you only came
up today  I see well I dont see why not I suppose apart from being
so tired I could drop  Come into my room for a few minutes then  We
certainly cant talk out here wed wake everyone up and I think that
would be more unpleasant for us than for them  Wait here till Ive put
the light on in my room and then turn the light down out here  K did
as he was told and then even waited until Miss Bürstner came out of her
room and quietly invited him once more to come in  Sit down she
said indicating the ottoman while she herself remained standing by the
bedpost despite the tiredness she had spoken of; she did not even take
off her hat which was small but decorated with an abundance of flowers
What is it you wanted then?  Im really quite curious  She gently
crossed her legs
I expect youll say K began that the matter really isnt all that
urgent and we dont need to talk about it right now but   I never
listen to introductions said Miss Bürstner  That makes my job so
much easier said K  This morning to some extent through my fault
your room was made a little untidy this happened because of people I
did not know and against my will but as I said because of my fault; I
wanted to apologise for it  My room? asked Miss Bürstner and
instead of looking round the room scrutinised K  It is true said K
and now for the first time they looked each other in the eyes
theres no point in saying exactly how this came about  But thats
the interesting thing about it said Miss Bürstner  No said K
Well then said Miss Bürstner I dont want to force my way into any
secrets if you insist that its of no interest I wont insist  Im
quite happy to forgive you for it as you ask especially as I cant see
anything at all thats been left untidy  With her hand laid flat on
her lower hip she made a tour around the room  At the mat where the
photographs were she stopped  Look at this she cried  My
photographs really have been put in the wrong places  Oh thats
horrible  Someone really has been in my room without permission  K
nodded and quietly cursed Kaminer who worked at his bank and who was
always active doing things that had neither use nor purpose  It is
odd said Miss Bürstner that Im forced to forbid you to do something
that you ought to have forbidden yourself to do namely to come into my
room when Im not here  But I did explain to you said K and went
over to join her by the photographs that it wasnt me who interfered
with your photographs; but as you dont believe me Ill have to admit
that the investigating committee brought along three bank employees with
them one of them must have touched your photographs and as soon as I
get the chance Ill ask to have him dismissed from the bank  Yes there
was an investigating committee here added K as the young lady was
looking at him enquiringly  Because of you? she asked  Yes
answered K  No the lady cried with a laugh  Yes they were said
K you believe that Im innocent then do you?  Well now innocent
 said the lady I dont want to start making any pronouncements
that might have serious consequences I dont really know you after all
it means theyre dealing with a serious criminal if they send an
investigating committee straight out to get him  But youre not in
custody now  at least I take it youve not escaped from prison
considering that you seem quite calm  so you cant have committed any
crime of that sort  Yes said K but it might be that the
investigating committee could see that Im innocent or not so guilty as
had been supposed  Yes thats certainly a possibility said Miss
Bürstner who seemed very interested  Listen said K you dont
have much experience in legal matters  No thats true I dont
said Miss Bürstner and Ive often regretted it as Id like to know
everything and Im very interested in legal matters  Theres something
peculiarly attractive about the law isnt there?  But Ill certainly be
perfecting my knowledge in this area as next month I start work in a
legal office  Thats very good said K that means youll be able
to give me some help with my trial  That could well be said Miss
Bürstner why not?  I like to make use of what I know  I mean it
quite seriously said K or at least half seriously as you do
This affair is too petty to call in a lawyer but I could make good use
of someone who could give me advice  Yes but if Im to give you
advice Ill have to know what its all about said Miss Bürstner
Thats exactly the problem said K I dont know that myself  So
you have been making fun of me then said Miss Bürstner exceedingly
disappointed you really ought not to try something like that on at
this time of night  And she stepped away from the photographs where
they had stood so long together  Miss Bürstner no said K Im not
making fun of you  Please believe me  Ive already told you everything
I know  More than I know in fact as it actually wasnt even an
investigating committee thats just what I called them because I dont
know what else to call them  There was no cross questioning at all I
was merely arrested but by a committee  Miss Bürstner sat on the
ottoman and laughed again  What was it like then? she asked  It was
terrible said K although his mind was no longer on the subject he
had become totally absorbed by Miss Bürstners gaze who was supporting
her chin on one hand  the elbow rested on the cushion of the ottoman 
and slowly stroking her hip with the other  Thats too vague said
Miss Bürstner  Whats too vague? asked K  Then he remembered himself
and asked Would you like me to show you what it was like?  He wanted
to move in some way but did not want to leave  Im already tired
said Miss Bürstner  You arrived back so late said K  Now youve
started telling me off  Well I suppose I deserve it as I shouldnt have
let you in here in the first place and it turns out there wasnt even
any point  Oh there was a point youll see now how important a
point it was said K  May I move this table away from your bedside
and put it here?  What do you think youre doing? said Miss Bürstner
Of course you cant  In that case I cant show you said K quite
upset as if Miss Bürstner had committed some incomprehensible offence
against him  Alright then if you need it to show what you mean just
take the bedside table then said Miss Bürstner and after a short
pause added in a weak voice  Im so tired Im allowing more than I
ought to  K put the little table in the middle of the room and sat
down behind it  You have to get a proper idea of where the people were
situated it is very interesting  Im the supervisor sitting over
there on the chest are two policemen standing next to the photographs
there are three young people  Hanging on the handle of the window is a
white blouse  I just mention that by the way  And now it begins  Ah
yes Im forgetting myself the most important person of all so Im
standing here in front of the table  The supervisor is sitting
extremely comfortably with his legs crossed and his arm hanging over the
backrest here like some layabout  And now it really does begin  The
supervisor calls out as if he had to wake me up in fact he shouts at
me Im afraid if Im to make it clear to you Ill have to shout as
well and its nothing more than my name that he shouts out  Miss
Bürstner laughing as she listened to him laid her forefinger on her
mouth so that K would not shout but it was too late  K was too
engrossed in his role and slowly called out Josef K  It was not as
loud as he had threatened but nonetheless once he had suddenly called
it out the cry seemed gradually to spread itself all round the room
        There was a series of loud curt and regular knocks at the door of
the adjoining room  Miss Bürstner went pale and laid her hand on her
heart  K was especially startled as for a moment he had been quite
unable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and
the girl for whom he was performing them  He had hardly pulled himself
together when he jumped over to Miss Bürstner and took her hand  Dont
be afraid he whispered Ill put everything right  But who can it
be?  Its only the living room next door nobody sleeps in there  Yes
they do whispered Miss Bürstner into Ks ear a nephew of Mrs
Grubachs an captain in the army has been sleeping there since
yesterday  Theres no other room free  Id forgotten about it too
Why did you have to shout like that?  Youve made me quite upset
There is no reason for it said K and now as she sank back onto the
cushion kissed her forehead  Go away go away she said hurriedly
sitting back up get out of here go what is it you want hes
listening at the door he can hear everything  Youre causing me so much
trouble  I wont go said K until youve calmed down a bit  Come
over into the other corner of the room he wont be able to hear us
there  She let him lead her there Dont forget he said although
this might be unpleasant for you youre not in any real danger  You
know how much esteem Mrs Grubach has for  me shes the one who will
make all the decisions in this especially as the captain is her nephew
but she believes everything I say without question  Whats more she
has borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent
on me  I will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here
together however inappropriate it might be and I guarantee to make
sure that Mrs Grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in
public but will believe it truly and sincerely  You will have no need
to consider me in any way  If you wish to let it be known that I have
attacked you then Mrs Grubach will be informed of such and she will
believe it without even losing her trust in me thats how much respect
she has for me  Miss Bürstner looked at the floor in front of her
quiet and a little sunk in on herself  Why would Mrs Grubach not
believe that Ive attacked you? added K He looked at her hair in front
of him parted bunched down reddish and firmly held in place  He
thought she would look up at him but without changing her manner she
said Forgive me but it was the suddenness of the knocking that
startled me so much not so much what the consequences of the captain
being here might be  It was all so quiet after youd shouted and then
there was the knocking thats was made me so shocked and I was sitting
right by the door the knocking was right next to me  Thank you for
your suggestions but I wont accept them  I can bear the
responsibility for anything that happens in my room myself and I can do
so with anyone  Im surprised you dont realise just how insulting your
suggestions are and what they imply about me although I certainly
acknowledge your good intentions  But now please go leave me alone I
need you to go now even more than I did earlier  The couple of minutes
you asked for have grown into half an hour more than half an hour now
K took hold of her hand and then of her wrist Youre not cross with
me though? he said  She pulled her hand away and answered No no
Im never cross with anyone  He grasped her wrist once more she
tolerated it now and in that way lead him to the door  He had fully
intended to leave  But when he reached the door he came to a halt as if
he hadnt expected to find a door there Miss Bürstner made use of that
moment to get herself free open the door slip out into the hallway and
gently say to K from there Now come along please  Look she
pointed to the captains door from under which there was a light
shining hes put a light on and hes laughing at us  Alright Im
coming said K moved forward took hold of her kissed her on the
mouth and then over her whole face like a thirsty animal lapping with
its tongue when it eventually finds water  He finally kissed her on her
neck and her throat and left his lips pressed there for a long time  He
did not look up until there was a noise from the captains room  Ill
go now he said he wanted to address Miss Bürstner by her Christian
name but did not know it  She gave him a tired nod offered him her
hand to kiss as she turned away as if she did not know what she was
doing and went back into her room with her head bowed  A short while
later K was lying in his bed He very soon went to sleep but before
he did he thought a little while about his behaviour he was satisfied
with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; él era
seriously worried about Miss Bürstner because of the captain
Chapter Two
First Crossexamination
        K was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing
concerning his case the following Sunday He was made aware that these
cross examinations would follow one another regularly perhaps not every
week but quite frequently On the one hand it was in everyones interest
to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion but on the other hand
every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly
without lasting too long because of the associated stress  For these
reasons it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations
following on one after another  Sunday had been chosen as the day for
the hearings so that K would not be disturbed in his professional work
It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this but if he wished
for another date then as far as possible he would be accommodated
Crossexaminations could even be held in the night for instance but K
would probably not be fresh enough at that time  Anyway as long as K
made no objection the hearing would be left on Sundays  It was a
matter of course that he would have to appear without fail there was
probably no need to point this out to him  He would be given the number
of the building where he was to present himself which was in a street
in a suburb well away from the city centre which K had never been to
antes de
        Once he had received this notice K hung up the receiver without
giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday it
was certainly necessary proceedings had begun and he had to face up to
it and this first examination would probably also be the last  He was
still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of
the deputy director behind him  he wanted to use the telephone but K
stood in his way  Bad news? asked the deputy director casually not
in order to find anything out but just to get K away from the device
No no said K he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely
The deputy director picked up the receiver and as he waited for his
connection turned away from it and said to K  One question Mr K:
Would you like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat
on Sunday morning?  Theres quite a few people coming youre bound to
know some of them  One of them is Hasterer the state attorney  Would
you like to come along?  Do come along  K tried to pay attention to
what the deputy director was saying  It was of no small importance for
him as this invitation from the deputy director with whom he had never
got on very well meant that he was trying to improve his relations with
him  It showed how important K had become in the bank and how its
second most important official seemed to value his friendship or at
least his impartiality  He was only speaking at the side of the
telephone receiver while he waited for his connection but in giving
this invitation the deputy director was humbling himself  But K would
have to humiliate him a second time as a result he said Thank you
very much but Im afraid I will have no time on Sunday I have a
previous obligation  Pity said the deputy director and turned to
the telephone conversation that had just been connected  It was not a
short conversation but K remained standing confused by the instrument
all the time it was going on  It was only when the deputy director hung
up that he was shocked into awareness and said in order to partially
excuse his standing there for no reason Ive just received a telephone
call theres somewhere I need to go but they forgot to tell me what
time  Ask them then said the deputy director  Its not that
important said K although in that way his earlier excuse already
weak enough was made even weaker  As he went the deputy director
continued to speak about other things  K forced himself to answer but
his thoughts were mainly about that Sunday how it would be best to get
there for nine oclock in the morning as that was the time that courts
always start work on weekdays
        The weather was dull on Sunday  K was very tired as he had
stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the
regulars and he had almost overslept  He dressed hurriedly without
the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out
during the week  With no breakfast he rushed to the suburb he had been
told about  Oddly enough although he had little time to look around
him he came across the three bank officials involved in his case
Rabensteiner Kullich and Kaminer  The first two were travelling in a
tram that went across Ks route but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a
café and leant curiously over the wall as K came over  All of them
seemed to be looking at him surprised at seeing their superior running;
it was  a kind of pride that made K want to go on foot this was his
affair and the idea of any help from strangers however slight was
repulsive to him he also wanted to avoid asking for anyones help
because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly
And after all he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the
committee by being too punctual  Anyway now he was running so that he
would get there by nine oclock if at all possible even though he had
no appointment for this time
        He had thought that he would recognise the building from a
distance by some kind of sign without knowing exactly what the sign
would look like or from some particular kind of activity outside the
entrance  K had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse but
when he stood at the streets entrance it consisted on each side of
almost nothing but monotonous grey constructions tall blocks of flats
occupied by poor people  Now on  a Sunday morning most of the windows
were occupied men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking or carefully
and gently held small children on the sills  Other windows were piled
up with bedding above which the dishevelled head of a woman would
briefly appear  People called out to each other across the street one
of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K himself  It was a long
street and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level
selling various kinds of foodstuffs which you reached by going down a
few steps  Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the
steps  A fruitmonger taking his goods up to the windows was just as
inattentive as K and nearly knocked him down with his cart  Just then
a gramophone which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn
out began to play some murderous tune
        K went further into the street slowly as if he had plenty of
time now or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one
of the windows and therefore knew that K had found his way there  It
was shortly after nine  The building was quite far down the street it
covered so much area it was almost extraordinary and the gateway in
particular was tall and long  It was clearly intended for delivery
wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were
now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K knew
from his work at the bank  In contrast with his usual habits he
remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all
these external details  Near him there was a barefooted man sitting
on a crate and reading a newspaper  There were two lads swinging on a
hand cart  In front of a pump stood a weak young girl in a bedjacket
who as the water flowed into her can looked at K  There was a piece
of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard with some
washing hanging on it to dry  A man stood below it calling out
instructions to direct the work being done
        K went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing
was to take place but then stood still again as besides these steps he
could see three other stairway entrances and there also seemed to be a
small passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard  It
irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the
room it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or
especially indifferent and he decided to make that clear to them very
loudly and very unambiguously  In the end he decided to climb up the
stairs his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the
policeman Willem saying to him; that the court is attracted by the
guilt from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway
that K selected by chance
        As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on
the stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows  Next
time I come here he said to himself I must either bring sweets with
me to make them like me or a stick to hit them with  Just before he
reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a
ball had finished its movement two small lads with sly faces like
grownup scoundrels held him by his trouserlegs until it had; si él
were to shake them off he would have to hurt them and he was afraid of
what noise they would make by shouting
        On the first floor his search began for real  He still felt
unable to ask for the investigating committee and so he invented a
joiner called Lanz  that name occurred to him because the captain Mrs
Grubachs nephew was called Lanz  so that he could ask at every flat
whether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look
into the rooms  It turned out though that that was mostly possible
without further ado as almost all the doors were left open and the
children ran in and out  Most of them were small onewindowed rooms
where they also did the cooking  Many women held babies in one arm and
worked at the stove with the other   Half grown girls who seemed to be
dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro  In
every room the beds were still in use by people who were ill or still
asleep or people stretched out on them in their clothes  K knocked at
the flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner
lived there   It was usually a woman who opened the door heard the
enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from
the bed  The gentlemans asking if a joiner called Lanz lives here
A joiner called Lanz? he would ask from the bed  Thats right K
would say although it was clear that the investigating committee was
not to be found there and so his task was at an end  There were many
who thought it must be very important for K to find Lanz the joiner and
thought long about it naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving
a name that had some vague similarity with Lanz or they asked
neighbours or accompanied K to a door a long way away where they
thought someone of that sort might live in the back part of the building
or where someone would be who could advise K better than they could
themselves  K eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to
be led all round from floor to floor in this way  He regretted his
initial plan which had at first seemed so practical to him  As he
reached the fifth floor he decided to give up the search took his
leave of a friendly young worker who wanted to lead him on still
further and went down the stairs  But then the thought of how much time
he was wasting made him cross he went back again and knocked at the
first door on the fifth floor  The first thing he saw in the small room
was a large clock on the wall which already showed ten oclock  Is
there a joiner called Lanz who lives here? he asked  Pardon? said a
young woman with black shining eyes who was at that moment washing
childrens underclothes in a bucket  She pointed her wet hand towards
the open door of the adjoining room
        K thought he had stepped into a meeting  A medium sized two
windowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people  nobody
paid any attention to the person who had just entered  Close under its
ceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and
where the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their
backs touching the ceiling  K who found the air too stuffy stepped
out again and said to the young woman who had probably misunderstood
what he had said I asked for a joiner someone by the name of Lanz
Yes said the woman please go on in  K would probably not have
followed her if the woman had not gone up to him taken hold of the door
handle and said Ill have to close the door after you noone else
will be allowed in  Very sensible said K but its too full
already  But then he went back in anyway  He passed through between
two men who were talking beside the door  one of them held both hands
far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money
the other looked him closely in the eyes  and someone took him by the
hand  It was a small redfaced youth  Come in come in he said
K let himself be led by him and it turned out that there was 
surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro  a
narrow passage which may have been the division between two factions;
this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the
left and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his
direction he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech
and their movements only towards members of their own side  Most of
them were dressed in black in old long formal frock coats that hung
down loosely around them  These clothes were the only thing that
puzzled  K as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a
local political meeting
        At the other end of the hall where K had been led there was a
little table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as
overcrowded as everywhere else and behind the table near the edge of
the podium sat a small fat wheezing man who was talking with someone
behind him  This second man was standing with his legs crossed and his
elbows on the backrest of the chair provoking much laughter  From time
to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone
The youth who was leading K had some difficulty in reporting to the
man  He had already tried twice to tell him something standing on tip
toe but without getting the mans attention as he sat there above him
It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention
to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it
was he quietly said  Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked
over at K  You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago
he said  K was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so as
hardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the
right hand side of the hall  You should have been here one hour and
five minutes ago the man now repeated raising his voice this time
and quickly looked round the hall beneath him  The muttering also
became immediately louder and as the man said nothing more died away
only gradually  Now the hall was much quieter than when K had entered
Only the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks  As
far as could be distinguished up in the halfdarkness dust and haze
they seemed to be less well dressed than those below  Many of them had
brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so
that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it
        K had decided he would do more watching than talking so he did
not defend himself for supposedly having come late and simply said
Well maybe I have arrived late Im here now  There followed loud
applause once more from the right hand side of the hall  Easy people
to get on your side thought K and was bothered only by the quiet from
the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there
was applause from only a few individuals  He wondered what he could say
to get all of them to support him together or if that were not
possible to at least get the support of the others for a while
        Yes said the man but Im now no longer under any obligation
to hear your case  there was once more a muttering but this time it
was misleading as the man waved the peoples objections aside with his
hand and continued  I will however as an exception continue with it
today  But you should never arrive late like this again  And now step
forward  Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a
place free for K and K stepped up onto it  He stood pressed closely
against the table the press of the crowd behind him was so great that
he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judges
desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it
        The judge however paid no attention to that but sat very
comfortably on his chair and after saying a few words to close his
discussion with the man behind him reached for a little note book the
only item on his desk  It was like an old school exercise book and had
become quite misshapen from much thumbing  Now then said the judge
thumbing through the book He turned to K with the tone of someone who
knows his facts and said you are a house painter?  No said K I
am the chief clerk in a large bank  This reply was followed by
laughter among the right hand faction down in the hall it was so hearty
that K couldnt stop himself joining in with it  The people supported
themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a
serious attack of coughing  Even some of those in the gallery were
laughing  The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power
over those below him in the hall he tried to reduce what harm had been
done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them his eyebrows until
then hardly remarkable pushed themselves up and became big black and
bushy over his eyes
        The left hand side of the hall was still quiet though the people
stood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium
listening to what was being said there they observed the noise from the
other side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some
individuals from their own ranks here and there to go forward into the
other faction  The people in the left faction were not only fewer in
number than the right but probably were no more important than them
although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they
were  When K now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in
the same way as them
        Your question My Lord as to whether I am a house painter  in
fact even more than that you did not ask at all but merely imposed it
on me  is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are
being carried out   Perhaps you will object that there are no
proceedings against me  You will be quite right as there are
proceedings only if I acknowledge that there are  But for the moment
I do acknowledge it out of pity for yourselves to a large extent  Its
impossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity  I
dont say things are being done without due care but I would like to
make it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement
K stopped speaking and looked down into the hall  He had spoken
sharply more sharply than he had intended but he had been quite right
It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but
everything was quiet they were all clearly waiting for what would
follow perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of
activity that would bring this whole affair to an end  It was somewhat
disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened the
young washerwoman who seemed to have finished her work came in and
despite all her caution attracted the attention of some of the people
there  It was only the judge who gave K any direct pleasure as he
seemed to have been immediately struck by Ks words  Until then he
had listened to him standing as Ks speech had taken him by surprise
while he was directing his attention to the gallery  Now in the pause
he sat down very slowly as if he did not want anyone to notice  He
took out the notebook again probably so that he could give the
impression of being calmer
        That wont help you sir continued K even your little book
will only confirm what I say  K was satisfied to hear nothing but his
own quiet words in this room full of strangers and he even dared
casually to pick up the examining judges notebook and touching it only
with the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting lifted
it in the air holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the
others on each side of it closely written blotted and yellowing
flapped down  Those are the official notes of the examining judge he
said and let the notebook fall down onto the desk  You can read in
your book as much as you like sir I really dont have anything in this
charge book to be afraid of even though I dont have access to it as I
wouldnt want it in my hand I can only touch it with two fingers  The
judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk  which
could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation or at least that is
how it must have been perceived  tried to tidy it up a little and held
it once more in front of himself in order to read from it
        The people in the front row looked up at him showing such tension
on their faces that he looked back down at them for some time  Every
one of them was an old man some of them with white beards  Could they
perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way
or the other?  They had sunk into a state of  motionlessness while K
gave his oration and it had not been possible to raise them from this
passivity even when the judge was being humiliated  What has happened
to me continued K with less of the vigour he had had earlier he
continually scanned the faces in the first row and this gave his
address a somewhat nervous and distracted character what has happened
to me is not just an isolated case  If it were it would not be of much
importance as its not of much importance to me but it is a symptom of
proceedings which are carried out against many  Its on behalf of them
that I stand here now not for myself alone
        Without having intended it he had raised his voice  Somewhere in
the hall someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting Bravo
Why not then?  Bravo  Again I say Bravo  Some of the men in the
first row groped around in their beards none of them looked round to
see who was shouting  Not even K thought him of any importance but it
did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all
of those in the hall should applaud him it was enough if the majority
of them began  to think about the matter and if only one of them now
and then was persuaded
        Im not trying to be a successful orator said K after this
thought thats probably more than Im capable of anyway  Im sure the
examining judge can speak far better than I can it is part of his job
after all  All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong
Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest the arrest itself is
something I laugh about but thats beside the point  They came for me
in the morning when I was still in bed  Maybe the order had been given
to arrest some house painter  that seems possible after what the judge
has said  someone who is as innocent as I am but it was me they chose
There were two police thugs occupying the next room  They could not
have taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber  And
these policemen were unprincipled riffraff they talked at me till I
was sick of it they wanted bribes they wanted to trick me into giving
them my clothes they wanted money supposedly so that they could bring
me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front
of my eyes  And even that was not enough  I was led in front of the
supervisor in another room  This was the room of a lady who I have a
lot of respect for and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and
the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me although not
through any fault of mine  It was not easy to stay calm but I managed
to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was
that I was under arrest  If he were here he would have to confirm what
I say  I can see him now sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I
mentioned  a picture of dullwitted arrogance  What do you think he
answered?  What he told me gentlemen was basically nothing at all;
perhaps he really did know nothing he had placed me under arrest and
was satisfied  In fact he had done more than that and brought three
junior employees from the bank where I work into the ladys room; ellos
had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged
to the lady and causing a mess  There was of course another reason
for bringing these employees; they just like my landlady and her maid
were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public
reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank
Well they didnt succeed in any of that not in the slightest even my
landlady who is quite a simple person  and I will give you here her
name in full respect her name is Mrs Grubach  even Mrs Grubach was
understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more
significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who
are not kept under proper control  I repeat this whole affair has
caused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation but could
it not also have had some far worse consequences?
        K broke off here and looked at the judge who said nothing  As
he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give
a sign to someone in the crowd  K smiled and said And now the judge
right next to me is giving a secret sign to someone among you  There
seems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above  I
dont know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause but
Ill resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon  It really
doesnt matter to me and I give his lordship the judge my full and
public permission to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate
down there and give his orders in words instead; let him just say Boo
now and then the next time Clap now
        Whether it was embarrassment or impatience the judge rocked
backwards and forwards on his seat  The man behind him whom he had
been talking with earlier leant forward again either to give him a few
general words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice  Below
them in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly
The two factions  had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to
each other but now they began to intermingle a few individuals pointed
up at K others pointed at the judge   The air in the room was fuggy
and extremely oppressive those who were standing furthest away could
hardly even be seen through it  It must have been especially
troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery as they were
forced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was
happening albeit with timid glances at the judge  The replies they
received were just as quiet and given behind the protection of a raised
mano
        I have nearly finished what I have to say said K and as there
was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that
startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each
other  None of this concerns me and I am therefore able to make a calm
assessment of it and assuming that this socalled court is of any real
importance it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I
have to say  If you want to discuss what I say please dont bother to
write it down until later on I dont have any time to waste and Ill
soon be leaving
        There was immediate silence which showed how well K was in
control of the crowd  There were no shouts among them as there had been
at the start noone even applauded but if they werent already
persuaded they seemed very close to it
        K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they
listened to him a rustling rose from the silence which was more
invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been  There is
no doubt he said quietly that there is some enormous organisation
determining what is said by this court  In my case this includes my
arrest and the examination taking place here today an organisation that
employs policemen who can be bribed oafish supervisors and judges of
whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as
some others  This organisation even maintains a highlevel judiciary
along with its train of countless servants scribes policemen and all
the other assistance that  it needs perhaps even executioners and
torturers  Im not afraid of using those words And what gentlemen is
the purpose of this enormous organisation?  Its purpose is to arrest
innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which as
in my case lead to no result  How are we to avoid those in office
becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning? Es decir
impossible not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for
himself  That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of
those they arrest that is why supervisors break into the homes of
people they do not know that is why innocent people are humiliated in
front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial  The policemen
only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those
they arrest I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won
possessions of people under arrest is left to decay if that is its
not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers
        K was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall
he shaded his eyes to see that far as the dull light of day made the
smoke whitish and hard to see through  It was the washerwoman whom K
had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had
entered  It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not  K
could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and
was pressing himself against her  But it was not her who was screaming
but the man he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling
A small circle had formed around the two of them the visitors near him
in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K had introduced
into the gathering had been disturbed in this way   Ks first thought
was to run over there and he also thought that everyone would want to
bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave
the room but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they
were noone moved and noone let K through  On the contrary they
stood in his way old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand
from somewhere  he did not have the time to turn round  took hold of
his collar  K by this time had forgotten about the pair it seemed
to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being
taken seriously and without any thought for what he was doing he
jumped down from the podium  Now he stood face to face with the crowd
Had he judged the people properly?  Had he put too much faith in the
effect of his speech?  Had they been putting up a pretence all the time
he had been speaking and now that he come to the end and to what must
follow were they tired of pretending?  What faces they were all around
him  Dark little eyes flickered here and there cheeks drooped down
like on drunken men their long beards were thin and stiff if they took
hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws
not as if they were taking hold of their own beards  But underneath
those beards  and this was the real discovery made by K  there were
badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their
coats  As far as he could see every one of them was wearing one of
these badges  All of them belonged to the same group even though they
seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him and when he
suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the
examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap
So called out K throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden
realisation needed more room all of you are working for this
organisation I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and
liars Ive just been speaking about youve all pressed yourselves in
here in order to listen in and snoop on me you gave the impression of
having formed into factions one of you even applauded me to test me
out and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man   Well I hope
you havent come here for nothing I hope youve either had some fun
from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else  let go
of me or Ill hit you shouted K to a quivery old man who had pressed
himself especially close to him  or else that youve actually learned
something  And so I wish you good luck in your trade  He briskly took
his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and surrounded by a
silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise pushed his
way to the exit  However the examining judge seems to have moved even
more quickly than K as he was waiting for him at the doorway  One
moment he said  K stood where he was but looked at the door with
his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge  I merely
wanted to draw your attention said the judge to something you seem
not yet to be aware of: today you have robbed yourself of the
advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is
under arrest  K laughed towards the door  You bunch of louts he
called you can keep all your hearings as a present from me then
opened the door and hurried down the steps  Behind him the noise of
the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to
discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them
Chapter Three
 In the empty Courtroom  The Student  The Offices
        Every day over the following week K expected another summons to
arrive he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had
been taken literally and when the expected summons really had not come
by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected without
being told to appear at the same place at the same time  So on Sunday
he set out once more in the same direction going without hesitation up
the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him
and greeted him from their doorways but he no longer needed to ask
anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door  It was opened as
soon as he knocked and paying no attention to the woman he had seen
last time who was standing at the doorway he was about to go straight
into the adjoining room when she said to him Theres no session today
What do you mean; no session? he asked unable to believe it  But the
woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room  It was indeed
empty and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous
Sunday  On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before
with a few books laying on it  Can I have a look at those books?
asked K not because he was especially curious but so that he would not
have come for nothing  No said the woman as she reclosed the door
thats not allowed  Those books belong to the examining judge  I
see said K and nodded those books must be law books and thats
how this court does things not only to try people who are innocent but
even to try them without letting them know whats going on  I expect
youre right said the woman who had not understood exactly what he
meant  Id better go away again then said K
Should I give a message to the examining judge? asked the woman  Do
you know him then? asked K  Of course I know him said the woman
my husband is the court usher  It was only now that K noticed that
the room which before had held nothing but a washtub had been fitted
out as a living room  The woman saw how surprised he was and said
Yes were allowed to live here as we like only we have to clear the
room out when the courts in session  Theres lots of disadvantages to
my husbands job  Its not so much the room that surprises me said
K looking at her crossly its your being married that shocks me
Are you thinking about what happened last time the court was in
session when I disturbed what you were saying? asked the woman  Of
course said K its in the past now and Ive nearly forgotten about
it but at the time it made me furious  And now you tell me yourself
that you are a married woman  It wasnt any disadvantage for you to
have your speech interrupted  The way they talked about you after youd
gone was really bad  That could well be said K turning away but
it does not excuse you  Theres noone I know whod hold it against
me said the woman Him who put his arms around me hes been chasing
after me for a long time  I might not be very attractive for most
people but I am for him  Ive got no protection from him even my
husband has had to get used to it; if he wants to keep his job hes got
to put up with it as that mans a student and hell almost certainly be
very powerful later on  Hes always after me hed only just left when
you arrived  That fits in with everything else said K Im not
surprised  Do you want to make things a bit better here? la mujer
asked slowly watching him as if she were saying something that could be
as dangerous for K as for herself  Thats what I thought when I heard
you speak I really liked what you said  Mind you I only heard part of
it I missed the beginning of it and at the end I was lying on the floor
with the student  its so horrible here she said after a pause and
took hold of Ks hand  Do you believe you really will be able to make
things better?  K smiled and twisted his hand round a little in her
soft hands  Its really not my job to make things better here as you
put it he said and if you said that to the examining judge he would
laugh at you or punish you for it  I really would not have become
involved in this matter if I could have helped it and I would have lost
no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be made better  But
because Im told that I have been arrested  and I am under arrest  it
forces me to take some action and to do so for my own sake  However
if I can be of some service to you in the process I will of course be
glad to do so  And I will be glad to do so not only for the sake of
charity but also because you can be of some help to me  How could I
help you then? said the woman  You could for example show me the
books on the table there  Yes certainly the woman cried and
pulled K along behind her as she rushed to them  The books were old
and well worn the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in its
middle and it was held together with a few threads  Everything is so
dirty here said K shaking his head and before he could pick the
books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron  K took
hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open an indecent picture
appeared  A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa the base intent of
whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking in
skill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and the
woman who dominated the picture with their bodies sitting in overly
upright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficult
for them to approach each other  K didnt thumb through that book any
more but just threw open the next one at its title page it was a novel
with the title What Grete Suffered from her Husband Hans  So this is
the sort of law book they study here said K this is the sort of
person sitting in judgement over me  I can help you said the woman
would you like me to?  Could you really do that without placing
yourself in danger?  You did say earlier on that your husband is wholly
dependent on his superiors  I still want to help you said the
woman come over here weve got to talk about it  Dont say any more
about what danger Im in I only fear danger where I want to fear it
Come over here  She pointed to the podium and invited him to sit down
on the step with her  Youve got lovely dark eyes she said after
they had sat down looking up into Ks face people say Ive got nice
eyes too but yours are much nicer  It was the first thing I noticed
when you first came here  Thats even why I came in here into the
assembly room afterwards Id never normally do that Im not really
even allowed to  So thats what all this is about thought K shes
offering herself to me shes as degenerate as everything else around
here shes had enough of the court officials which is understandable I
suppose and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about
his eyes  With that K stood up in silence as if he had spoken his
thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the woman  I dont
think you can be of any assistance to me he said to be of any real
assistance you would need to be in contact with high officials  But Im
sure you only know the lower employees and there are crowds of them
milling about here  Im sure youre very familiar with them and could
achieve a great deal through them Ive no doubt of that but the most
that could be done through them would have no bearing at all on the
final outcome of the trial  You on the other hand would lose some of
your friends as a result and I have no wish of that  Carry on with
these people in the same way as you have been as it does seem to me to
be something you cannot do without  I have no regrets in saying this
as in return for your compliment to me I also find you rather
attractive especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now
although you really have no reason to do so  You belong to the people I
have to combat and youre very comfortable among them youre even in
love with the student or if you dont love him you do at least prefer
him to your husband  Its easy to see that from what youve been
saying  No she shouted remained sitting where she was and grasped
Ks hand which he failed to pull away fast enough  You cant go away
now you cant go away when youve misjudged me like that  Are you
really capable of going away now?  Am I really so worthless that you
wont even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer? Tú
misunderstand me said K sitting back down if its really important
to you for me to stay here then Ill be glad to do so I have plenty of
time I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place  All I
meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my
behalf in the proceedings against me  But even that is nothing for you
to worry about when you consider that theres nothing hanging on the
outcome of this trial and that whatever the verdict I will just laugh
at it  And thats even presupposing it ever even reaches any
conclusion which I very much doubt  I think its much more likely that
the court officials will be too lazy too forgetful or even to fearful
ever to continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be
abandoned if they havent been abandoned already  Its even possible
that they will pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of
receiving a large bribe although I can tell you now that that will be
quite in vain as I pay bribes to noone  Perhaps one favour you could
do me would be to tell the examining judge or anyone else who likes to
spread important news that I will never be induced to pay any sort of
bribe through any stratagem of theirs  and Im sure they have many
stratagems at their disposal  There is no prospect of that you can
tell them that quite openly  And whats more I expect they have
already noticed themselves or even if they havent this affair is
really not so important to me as they think  Those gentlemen would only
save some work for themselves or at least some unpleasantness for me
which however I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of
unpleasantness for me is a blow against them  And I will make quite
sure it is a blow against them  Do you actually know the judge?
Course I do said the woman he was the first one I thought of when I
offered to help you  I didnt know hes only a minor official but if
you say so it must be true  Mind you I still think the report he gives
to his superiors must have some influence  And he writes so many
reports  You say these officials are lazy but theyre certainly not
all lazy especially this examining judge he writes ever such a lot
Last Sunday for instance that session went on till the evening
Everyone had gone but the examining judge he stayed in the hall I had
to bring him a lamp in all I had was a little kitchen lamp but he was
very satisfied with it and started to write straight away  Meantime my
husband arrived he always has the day off on Sundays we got the
furniture back in and got our room sorted out and then a few of the
neighbours came we sat and talked for a bit by a candle in short we
forgot all about the examining judge and went to bed  All of a sudden
in the night it must have been quite late in the night I wakes up
next to the bed theres the examining judge shading the lamp with his
hand so that theres no light from it falls on my husband he didnt
need to be as careful as that the way my husband sleeps the light
wouldnt have woken him up anyway  I was quite shocked and nearly
screamed but the judge was very friendly warned me I should be
careful he whispered to me hes been writing all this time and now
hes brought me the lamp back and hell never forget how I looked when
he found me there asleep  What I mean with all this I just wanted to
tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports
especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main
things on the agenda that Sunday   If he writes reports as long as that
they must be of some importance   And besides all that you can see
from what happened that the examining judge is after me and its right
now when hes first begun to notice me that I can have a lot of
influence on him  And Ive got other proof I mean a lot to him too
Yesterday he sent that student to me the one he really trusts and who
he works with he sent him with a present for me silk stockings  He
said it was because I clear up in the courtroom but thats only a
pretence that jobs no more than what Im supposed to do its what my
husband gets paid for  Nice stockings they are look  she stretched
out her leg drew her skirt up to her knee and looked herself at the
stocking  they are nice stockings but theyre too good for me
De Verdad
        She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on Ks as if
she wanted to calm him down and whispered Be quiet Berthold is
watching us  K slowly looked up  In the doorway to the courtroom
stood a young man he was short his legs were not quite straight and
he continually moved his finger round in a short thin red beard with
which he hoped to make himself look dignified  K looked at him with
some curiosity he was the first student he had ever met of the
unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence face to face at least a man who
would even most likely attain high office one day  The student in
contrast seemed to take no notice of K at all he merely withdrew his
finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over
to the window the woman leant over to K and whispered Dont be cross
with me please dont and please dont think ill of me either Ive got
to go to him now to this horrible man just look at his bent legs  But
Ill come straight back and then Ill go with you if youll take me
Ill go wherever you want you can do whatever you like with me Ill be
happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible itd be best
if I could get away from here for good  She stroked Ks hand once
more jumped up and ran over to the window  Before he realised it K
grasped for her hand but failed to catch it   He really was attracted
to the woman and even after thinking hard about it could find no good
reason why he should not give in to her allure  It briefly crossed his
mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court but that
was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off  In what way could
she entrap him?  Was he not still free so free that he could crush the
entire court whenever he wanted as least where it concerned him?  Could
he not have that much confidence in himself?  And her offer of help
sounded sincere and maybe it wasnt quite worthless  And maybe there
was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than
to take this woman from him and have her for himself  Maybe then after
much hard work writing dishonest reports about K the judge would go to
the womans bed late one night and find it empty  And it would be empty
because she belonged to K because this woman at the window this lush
supple warm body in its sombre clothes of rough heavy material
belonged to him totally to him and to him alone  Once he had settled
his thoughts towards the woman in this way he began to find the quiet
conversation at the window was taking too long he rapped on the podium
with his knuckles and then even with his fist  The student briefly
looked away from the woman to glance at K over his shoulder but did
allow himself to be disturbed in fact he even pressed himself close to
the woman and put his arms around her  She dropped her head down low as
if listening to him carefully as she did so he kissed her right on the
neck hardly even interrupting what he was saying   K saw this as
confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which
she had already complained about he stood up and walked up and down the
room  Glancing sideways at the student he wondered what would be the
quickest possible way to get rid of him and so it was not unwelcome to
him when the student clearly disturbed by Ks toing and froing which
K had now developed into a stamping up and down said to him
You dont have to stay here you know if youre getting impatient
You could have gone earlier noone would have missed you  In fact you
should have gone you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as
I got here  This comment could have caused all possible rage to break
out between them but K also bore in mind that this was a prospective
court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant and he might well
have been taking pride in speaking in this way  K remained standing
quite close to him and said with a smile Youre quite right I am
impatient but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you
left us  On the other hand if youve come here to study  you are a
student I hear  Ill be quite happy to leave the room to you and go
away with the woman  Im sure youll still have a lot of study to do
before youre made into a judge  Its true that Im still not all that
familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a
lot more than speaking roughly  and I see you have no shame in doing
that extremely well  He shouldnt have been allowed to move about so
freely said the student as if he wanted to give the woman an
explanation for Ks insults that was a mistake  Ive told the
examining judge so  He should at least have been detained in his room
between hearings  Sometimes its impossible to understand what the
judge thinks hes doing
Youre wasting your breath said K then he reached his hand out
towards the woman and said come with me  So thats it said the
student oh no youre not going to get her and with a strength you
would not have expected from him he glanced tenderly at her lifted her
up on one arm and his back bent under the weight ran with her to the
door  In this way he showed unmistakeably that he was to some extent
afraid of K but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by
stroking and squeezing the womans arm with his free hand  K ran the
few steps up to him but when he had reached him and was about to take
hold of him and if necessary throttle him the woman said Its no
good its the examining judge whos sent for me I darent go with you
this little bastard and here she ran her hand over the students
face this little bastard wont let me  And you dont want to be set
free shouted K laying his hand on the students shoulder who then
snapped at it with his teeth  No shouted the woman pushing K away
with both hands no no dont do that what dyou think youre doing?
Thatd be the end of me  Let go of him please just let go of him
Hes only carrying out the judges orders hes carrying me to him
Let him take you then and I want to see nothing more of you said K
enraged by his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back
so that he briefly stumbled and then glad that he had not fallen
immediately jumped up all the higher with his burden  K followed them
slowly  He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had
suffered from these people  It was of course nothing to worry about he
accepted the setback only because he was looking for a fight  If he
stayed at home and carried on with his normal life he would be a
thousand times superior to these people and could get any of them out of
his way just with a kick  And he imagined the most laughable scene
possible as an example of this if this contemptible student this
inflated child this knockkneed redbeard if he were kneeling at Elsas
bed wringing his hands and begging for forgiveness  K so enjoyed
imagining this scene that he decided to take the student along to Elsa
with him if ever he should get the opportunity
        K was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he
hurried over to the door the student was not likely to carry her
through the streets on his arm  It turned out that the journey was far
shorter  Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden
steps which probably led up to the attic they turned as they went so
that it was not possible to see where they ended  The student carried
the woman up these steps and after the exertions of running with her he
was soon groaning and moving very slowly  The woman waved down at K
and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was
an innocent party in this abduction although the gesture did not show a
lot of regret  K watched her without expression like a stranger he
wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily
get over his disappointment
        The two of them had disappeared but K remained standing in the
doorway  He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but
that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the
examining judge  The examining judge certainly wouldnt be sitting and
waiting in the attic  The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him
however long he stared at them  Then K noticed a small piece of paper
next to them went across to it and read in a childish and unpractised
hand Entrance to the Court Offices  Were the court offices here in
the attic of this tenement then?  If that was how they were
accommodated it did not attract much respect and it was some comfort
for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its
disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of
the building who were themselves among the poorest of people would
throw their unneeded junk  On the other hand it was possible that the
officials  had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves
rather than use it for the courts purposes  Going by Ks experience
of them so far that even seemed probable except that if the court were
allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but
also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply  in a
state of poverty  K also now understood that the court was ashamed to
summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial
hearing and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes
What a position it was that K found himself in compared with the judge
sitting up in the attic  K at the bank had a big office with an
anteroom and had an enormous window through which he could look down
at the activity in the square  It was true though that he had no
secondary income from bribes and fraud and he couldnt tell a servant
to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm  K however was
quite willing to do without such things in this life at least  K was
still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs looked
through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to
see the courtroom and finally asked K whether he had just seen a woman
there  Youre the court usher arent you? asked K  Thats right
said the man oh yes youre defendant K I recognise you now as
well  Nice to see you here  And he offered K his hand which was far
from what K had expected  And when K said nothing he added Theres
no court session planned for today though  I know that said K as
he looked at the ushers civilian coat which beside its ordinary
buttons displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and
seemed to have been taken from an old army officers coat  I was
speaking with your wife a little while ago  She is no longer here  The
student has carried her off to the examining judge  Listen to this
said the usher theyre always carrying her away from me  Its Sunday
today and its not part of my job to do any work today but they send
me off with some message which isnt even necessary just to get me away
from here  What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I
can still hope to get back on time if I really hurry  So off I go
running as fast as I can shout the message through the crack in the
door of the office Ive been sent to so out of breath theyll hardly be
able to understand it run back here again but the students been even
faster than I have  well hes got less far to go hes only got to run
down the steps  If I wasnt so dependent on them Id have squashed the
student against the wall here a long time ago  Right here next to the
sign  Im always dreaming of doing that  Just here just above the
floor thats where hes crushed onto the wall his arms stretched out
his fingers spread apart his crooked legs twisted round into a circle
and blood squirted out all around him  Its only ever been a dream so
far though  Is there nothing else you do? asked K with a smile
Nothing that I know of said the usher  And its going to get even
worse now up till now hes only been carrying her off for himself now
hes started carrying her off for the judge and all just like Id
always said he would  Does your wife then not share some of the
responsibility? asked K  He had to force himself as he asked this
question as he too felt so jealous now  Course she does said the
usher its more her fault than theirs  It was her who attached
herself to him  All he did he just chases after any woman  Theres
five flats in this block alone where hes been thrown out after working
his way in there  And my wife is the best looking woman in the whole
building but its me whos not even allowed to defend himself  If
thats how things are then theres nothing that can be done said K
Well why not? asked the usher  Hes a coward that student if he
wants to lay a finger on my wife all youd have to do is give him such a
good hiding hed never dare do it again  But Im not allowed to do
that and nobody else is going to do me the favour as theyre all afraid
of his power  The only one who could do it is a man like you  What
how could I do it? asked K in astonishment
Well youre facing a charge arent you said the usher  Yes but
thats all the more reason for me to be afraid  Even if he has no
influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the
initial examination  Yes exactly said the usher as if Ks view
had been just as correct as his own  Only we dont usually get any
trials heard here with no hope at all  I am not of the same opinion
said K although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the
student if the opportunity arises  I would be very grateful to you
said the usher of the court somewhat formally not really seeming to
believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled  Perhaps continued
K perhaps there are some other officials of yours here perhaps all
of them who would deserve the same  Oh yes yes said the usher as
if this was a matter of course  Then he looked at K trustingly which
despite all his friendliness he had not done until then and added
theyre always rebelling  But the conversation seemed to have become
a little uncomfortable for him as he broke it off by saying now I
have to report to the office  Would you like to come with me?
Theres nothing for me to do there said K
Youd be able to have a look at it  Noone will take any notice of
you  Is it worth seeing then? asked K hesitatingly although he
felt very keen to go with him  Well said the usher I thought youd
be interested in it  Alright then said K finally Ill come with
you  And quicker than the usher himself he ran up the steps
        At the entrance he nearly fell over as behind the door there was
another step They dont show much concern for the public he said
They dont show any concern at all said the usher just look at the
waiting room here  It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly
made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic  There was
no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the
departments instead of solid walls had just wooden bars reaching up to
the ceiling to separate them from the corridor  The light made its way
in through them and it was also possible to see individual officials
through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the
wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the
gaps  There were only a few people in the corridor probably because it
was Sunday  They were not very impressive  They sat equally spaced
on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both
sides of the corridor  All of them were carelessly dressed although the
expressions on their faces their bearing the style of their beards and
many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to
the upper classes  There were no coat hooks for them to use and so
they had placed their hats under the bench each probably having
followed the example of the others  When those who were sitting nearest
the door saw K and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them
and when the others saw that they also thought they had to greet them
so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up  None
of them stood properly upright their backs were bowed their knees
bent they stood like beggars on the street  K waited for the usher
who was following just behind him  They must all be very dispirited
he said  Yes said the usher they are the accused everyone you see
here has been accused  Really said K  Theyre colleagues of mine
then  And he turned to the nearest one a tall thin man with hair
that was nearly grey  What is it you are waiting for here? asked K
politely but the man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly
which was all the more pitiful to see because the man clearly had some
experience of the world and elsewhere would certainly have been able to
show his superiority and would not have easily given up the advantage he
had acquired  Here though he did not know what answer to give to such
a simple question and looked round at the others as if they were under
some obligation to help him and as if noone could expect any answer
from him without this help  Then the usher of the court stepped forward
to him and in order to calm him down and raise his spirits said The
gentleman heres only asking what it is youre waiting for  You can
give him an answer  The voice of the usher was probably familiar to
him and had a better effect than Ks  Im  Im waiting  he
began and then came to a halt  He had clearly chosen this beginning so
that he could give a precise answer to the question but now he didnt
know how to continue  Some of the others waiting had come closer and
stood round the group the usher of the court said to them Get out the
way keep the gangway free  They moved back slightly but not as far
as where they had been sitting before  In the meantime the man whom K
had first approached had pulled himself together and even answered him
with a smile
A month ago I made some applications for evidence to be heard in my
case and Im waiting for it to be settled  You certainly seem to be
going to a lot of effort said K  Yes said the man it is my
affair after all  Not everyone thinks the same way as you do said
K Ive been indicted as well but I swear on my soul that Ive neither
submitted evidence nor done anything else of the sort  Do you really
think thats necessary?  I dont really know exactly said the man
once more totally unsure of himself; he clearly thought K was joking
with him and therefore probably thought it best to repeat his earlier
answer in order to avoid making any new mistakes  With K looking at
him impatiently he just said as far as Im concerned Ive applied to
have this evidence heard  Perhaps you dont believe Ive been
indicted? asked K  Oh please I certainly do said the man
stepping slightly to one side but there was more anxiety in his answer
than belief  You dont believe me then? asked K and took hold of
his arm unconsciously prompted by the mans humble demeanour and as if
he wanted to force him to believe him  But he did not want to hurt the
man and had only taken hold of him very lightly  Nonetheless the man
cried out as if K had grasped him not with two fingers but with red hot
tongs  Shouting in this ridiculous way finally made K tired of him if
he didnt believe he was indicted then so much the better; maybe he even
thought K was a judge  And before leaving he held him a lot harder
shoved him back onto the bench and walked on  These defendants are so
sensitive most of them said the usher of the court  Almost all of
those who had been waiting had now assembled around the man who by now
had stopped shouting and they seemed to be asking him lots of precise
questions about the incident  K was approached by a security guard
identifiable mainly by his sword of which the scabbard seemed to be
made of aluminium  This greatly surprised K and he reached out for it
with his hand  The guard had come because of the shouting and asked
what had been happening  The usher of the court said a few words to try
and calm him down but the guard explained that he had to look into it
himself saluted and hurried on walking with very short steps
probably because of gout
        K didnt concern himself long with the guard or these people
especially as he saw a turning off the corridor about half way along it
on the right hand side where there was no door to stop him going that
way  He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go the usher
nodded and that is the way that K went  The usher remained always one
or two steps behind K which he found irritating as in a place like this
it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone
who had arrested him so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up
but the usher always remained behind him  In order to put an end to his
discomfort K finally said Now that Ive seen what it looks like
here Id like to go  You havent seen everything yet said the
usher ingenuously
I dont want to see everything said K who was also feeling very
tired I want to go what is the way to the exit?  You havent got
lost have you? asked the usher in amazement you go down this way to
the corner then right down the corridor straight ahead as far as the
door  Come with me said K show me the way Ill miss it there
are so many different ways here  Its the only way there is said
the usher who had now started to sound quite reproachful I cant go
back with you again Ive got to hand in my report and Ive already
lost a lot of time because of you as it is  Come with me K
repeated now somewhat sharper as if he had finally caught the usher out
in a lie  Dont shout like that whispered the usher theres
offices all round us here  If you dont want to go back by yourself
come on a bit further with me or else wait here till Ive sorted out my
report then Ill be glad to go back with you again  No no said
K I will not wait and you must come with me now  K had still not
looked round at anything at all in the room where he found himself and
it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around him opened that
he noticed it  A young woman probably summoned by the loudness of Ks
voice entered and asked What is it the gentleman wants? En el
darkness behind her there was also a man approaching  K looked at the
usher  He had after all said that noone would take any notice of K
and now there were two people coming it only needed a few and everyone
in the office would become aware of him and asking for explanations as
to why he was there  The only understandable and acceptable thing to
say was that he was accused of something and wanted to know the date of
his next hearing but this was an explanation he did not want to give
especially as it was not true  he had only come out of curiosity  Or
else an explanation even less usable he could say that he wanted to
ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as it was on the
outside  And it did seem that he had been quite right in this
supposition he had no wish to intrude any deeper he was disturbed
enough by what he had seen already he was not in the right frame of
mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind
any door and he wanted to go either with the usher of the court or if
needs be alone
        But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence and
the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they
thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which
they didnt want to miss seeing  And in the doorway stood the man whom
K had noticed in the background earlier he held firmly on to the beam
above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if
becoming impatient as he watched  But the young woman was the first to
recognise that Ks behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell
she brought a chair and asked
Would you not like to sit down?  K sat down immediately and in order
to keep his place better put his elbows on the armrests  Youre a
little bit dizzy arent you? she asked him  Her face was now close in
front of him it bore the severe expression that many young women have
just when theyre in the bloom of their youth  Its nothing for you to
worry about she said thats nothing unusual here almost everyone
gets an attack like that the first time they come here  This is your
first time is it?  Yes its nothing unusual then  The sun burns down
on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so thick and heavy  It makes
this place rather unsuitable for offices whatever other advantages it
might offer  But the air is almost impossible to breathe on days when
theres a lot of business and thats almost every day  And when you
think that theres a lot of washing put out to dry here as well  and we
cant stop the tenants doing that  its not surprising you started to
feel unwell  But you get used to the air alright in the end  When
youre here for the second or third time youll hardly notice how
oppressive the air is  Are you feeling any better now?  K made no
answer he felt too embarrassed at being put at the mercy of these
people by his sudden weakness and learning the reason for feeling ill
made him feel not better but a little worse  The girl noticed it
straight away and to make the air fresher for K she took a window
pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small hatch
directly above Ks head that led to the outside  But so much soot fell
in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean the
soot off Ks hands with her handkerchief as K was too tired to do
that for himself  He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was
until he had enough strength to leave and the less fuss people made
about him the sooner that would be  But then the girl said You cant
stay here were in peoples way here   K looked at her as if to
ask whose way they were impeding  If you like I can take you to the
sick room and turning to the man in the doorway said please help
me  The man immediately came over to them but K did not want to go
to the sick room that was just what he wanted to avoid being led
further from place to place the further he went the more difficult it
must become  So he said I am able to walk now and stood up shaking
after becoming used to sitting so comfortably  But then he was unable
to stay upright I cant manage it he said shaking his head and sat
down again with a sigh  He remembered the usher who despite
everything would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed
to have gone long before  K looked out between the man and the young
woman who were standing in front of him but was unable to find the
usher  I think said the man who was elegantly dressed and whose
appearance was made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had
two long sharply tailored points the gentleman is feeling unwell
because of the atmosphere here so the best thing and what he would
most prefer would be not to take him to the sick room but get him out
of the offices altogether  Thats right exclaimed K with such joy
that he nearly interrupted what the man was saying Im sure thatll
make me feel better straight away Im really not that weak all I need
is a little support under my arms I wont cause you much trouble its
not such a long way anyway lead me to the door and then Ill sit on the
stairs for a while and soon recover as I dont suffer from attacks like
this at all Im surprised at it myself  I also work in an office and
Im quite used to office air but here it seems to be too strong youve
said so yourselves  So please be so kind as to help me on my way a
little Im feeling dizzy you see and itll make me ill if I stand up
by myself  And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for
the two of them to take him by the arms
        The man however didnt follow this suggestion but just stood
there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud
There you see he said to the girl I was quite right  The
gentleman is only unwell here and not in general  The young woman
smiled too but lightly tapped the mans arm with the tips of her
fingers as if he had allowed himself too much fun with K  So what do
you think then? said the man still laughing I really do want to
lead the gentleman out of here  Thats alright then said the girl
briefly inclining her charming head  Dont worry too much about him
laughing said the girl to K who had become unhappy once more and
stared quietly in front of himself as if needing no further explanation
This gentleman  may I introduce you?  (the man gave his permission
with a wave of the hand)  so this gentlemans job is to give out
information  He gives all the information they need to people who are
waiting as our court and its offices are not very well known among the
public he gets asked for quite a lot  He has an answer for every
question you can try him out if you feel like it  But thats not his
only distinction his other distinction is his elegance of dress  We
thats to say all of us who work in the offices here we decided that
the informationgiver would have to be elegantly dressed as he
continually has to deal with the litigants and hes the first one they
meet so he needs to give a dignified first impression  The rest of us
Im afraid as you can see just by looking at me dress very badly and
oldfashioned; and theres not much point in spending much on clothes
anyway as we hardly ever leave the offices we even sleep here  But
as I said we decided that the informationgiver would have to have nice
clothes  As the management here is rather peculiar in this respect and
they would get them for us we had a collection  some of the litigants
contributed too  and bought him these lovely clothes and some others
besides  So everything would be ready for him to give a good
impression except that he spoils it again by laughing and frightening
people  Thats how it is said the man mocking her but I dont
understand why it is that youre explaining all our intimate facts to
the gentleman or rather why it is that youre pressing them on him as
Im sure hes not all interested  Just look at him sitting there its
clear hes occupied with his own affairs  K just did not feel like
contradicting him The girls intention may have been good perhaps she
was under instructions to distract him or to give him the chance to
collect himself but the attempt had not worked  I had to explain to
him why you were laughing said the girl  I suppose it was
insulting  I think he would forgive even worse insults if I finally
took him outside  K said nothing did not even look up he tolerated
the two of them negotiating over him like an object that was even what
suited him best  But suddenly he felt the informationgivers hand on
one arm and the young womans hand on the other  Up you get then
weakling said the informationgiver  Thank you both very much said
K pleasantly surprised as he slowly rose and personally guided these
unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support
As they approached the corridor the girl said quietly into Ks ear I
must seem to think its very important to show the informationgiver in
a good light but you shouldnt doubt what I say I just want to say the
truth  He isnt hardhearted  Its not really his job to help
litigants outside if theyre unwell but hes doing it anyway as you can
see  I dont suppose any of us is hardhearted perhaps wed all like
to be helpful but working for the court offices its easy for us to
give the impression we are hardhearted and dont want to help anyone
It makes me quite sad  Would you not like to sit down here a while?
asked the informationgiver there were already in the corridor and just
in front of the defendant whom K had spoken to earlier  K felt almost
ashamed to be seen by him earlier he had stood so upright in front of
him and now he had to be supported by two others his hat was held up by
the informationgiver balanced on outstretched fingers his hair was
dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead  But the
defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood
there humbly as if wanting to apologise to the informationgiver for
being there The informationgiver looked past him  I know he said
that my case cant be settled today not yet but Ive come in anyway
I thought I thought I could wait here anyway its Sunday today Ive
got plenty of time and Im not disturbing anyone here  Theres no
need to be so apologetic said the informationgiver its very
commendable for you to be so attentive  You are taking up space here
when you dont need to but as long as you dont get in my way I will do
nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as
you like  When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their
cases one learns to show patience with people like you   Do sit down
Hes very good with the litigants whispered the girl  K nodded but
started to move off again when the informationgiver repeated Would
you not like to sit down here a while?  No said K I dont want to
rest  He had said that as decisively as he could but in fact it
would have done him a lot of good to sit down  It was as if he were
suffering seasickness  He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea
as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls a thundering from
the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it as
if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of
it rising and sinking  It made the calmness of the girl and the man
leading him all the more incomprehensible  He was at their mercy if
they let go of him he would fall like a board  Their little eyes
glanced here and there K could feel the evenness of their steps but
could not do the same as from step to step he was virtually being
carried  He finally noticed they were speaking to him but he did not
understand them all he heard was a noise that filled all the space and
through which there seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding
like a siren  Louder he whispered with his head sunk low ashamed at
having to ask them to speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly
enough even if it had been for him incomprehensible  At last a
draught of cool air blew in his face as if a gap had been torn out in
the wall in front of him and next to him he heard someone say First
he says he wants to go and then you can tell him a hundred times that
this is the way out and he doesnt move  K became aware that he was
standing in front of the way out and that the young woman had opened
the door  It seemed to him that all his strength returned to him at
once and to get a foretaste of freedom he stepped straight on to one of
the stairs and took his leave there of his companions who bowed to him
Thank you very much he repeated shook their hands once more and did
not let go until he thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the
comparatively fresh air from the stairway after being so long used to
the air in the offices  They were hardly able to reply and the young
woman might even have fallen over if K had not shut the door extremely
fast  K then stood still for a while combed his hair with the help of
a pocket mirror picked up his hat from the next stair  the
informationgiver must have thrown it down there  and then he ran down
the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his
previous state nearly frightened him  His normally sturdy state of
health had never prepared him for surprises such as this  Did his body
want to revolt and cause him a new trial as he was bearing the old one
with such little effort?  He did not quite reject the idea that he
should see a doctor the next time he had the chance but whatever he did
 and this was something on which he could advise himself  he wanted to
spend all Sunday mornings in future better than he had spent this one
Chapter Four
Miss Bürstners Friend
        For some time after this K found it impossible to exchange even
just a few words with Miss Bürstner  He tried to reach her in many and
various ways but she always found a way to avoid it  He would come
straight home from the office remain in her room without the light on
and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch
on the empty hallway  If the maid went by and closed the door of the
apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again
He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might
perhaps find Miss Bürstner alone as she went to the office  But none of
these efforts brought any success  Then he wrote her a letter both to
the office and the flat attempting once more to justify his behaviour
offered to make whatever amends he could promised never to cross
whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance
to speak to her some time especially as he was unable to do anything
with Mrs Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Bürstner he
finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room
all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his
request being fulfilled or at least that she would explain to him why
she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever
stipulations she might make  The letters were not returned but there
was no answer either  However on the following Sunday there was a sign
that seemed clear enough  It was still early when K noticed through
the keyhole that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway
which soon abated  A French teacher although she was German and called
Montag a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously
occupied a room of her own was moving into Miss Bürstners room  She
could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours there was
always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had
forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home
        When Mrs Grubach brought K his breakfast  ever since the time
when she had made K so cross she didnt trust the maid to do the
slightest job  he had no choice but to speak to her for the first time
in five days  Why is there so much noise in the hallway today? él
asked as she poured his coffee out Cant something be done about it?
Does this clearing out have to be done on a Sunday?  K did not look up
at Mrs Grubach but he saw nonetheless that she seemed to feel some
relief as she breathed in  Even sharp questions like this from Mr K
she perceived as forgiveness or as the beginning of forgiveness
Were not clearing anything out Mr K she said its just that
Miss Montag is moving in with Miss Bürstner and is moving her things
across  She said nothing more but just waited to see how K would
take it and whether he would allow her to carry on speaking  But K
kept her in uncertainty took the spoon and pensively stirred his coffee
while he remained silent  Then he looked up at her and said What
about the suspicions you had earlier about Miss Bürstner have you given
them up?  Mr K called Mrs Grubach who had been waiting for this
very question as she put her hands together and held them out towards
him  I just made a chance remark and you took it so badly  I didnt
have the slightest intention of offending anyone not you or anyone
else  Youve known me for long enough Mr K Im sure youre
convinced of that  You dont know how Ive been suffering for the past
few days  That I should tell lies about my tenants  And you Mr K
you believed it  And said I should give you notice  Give you notice
At this last outcry Mrs Grubach was already choking back her tears
she raised her apron to her face and blubbered out loud
        Oh dont cry Mrs Grubach said K looking out the window he
was thinking only of Miss Bürstner and how she was accepting an unknown
girl into her room  Now dont cry he said again as he turned his
look back into the room where Mrs Grubach was still crying  I meant
no harm either when I said that  It was simply a misunderstanding
between us  That can happen even between old friends sometimes  Mrs
Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K really
was attempting a reconciliation  Well yes thats how it is said
K and as Mrs Grubachs behaviour indicated that the captain had said
nothing he dared to add Do you really think then that Id want to
make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know? Sí
youre quite right Mr K said Mrs Grubach and then to her
misfortune as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak she added
something rather inept  I kept asking myself why it was that Mr K
took such an interest in Miss Bürstner  Why does he quarrel with me
over her when he knows that any cross word from him and I cant sleep
that night?  And I didnt say anything about Miss Bürstner that I hadnt
seen with my own eyes  K said nothing in reply he should have chased
her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth and he didnt
want to do that  He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee
and letting Mrs Grubach feel that she was superfluous  Outside the
dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one
side of the hallway to the other  Do you hear that? asked K pointing
his hand at the door  Yes said Mrs Grubach with a sigh I wanted
to give her some help and I wanted the maid to help her too but shes
stubborn she wants to move everything in herself  I wonder at Miss
Bürstner  I often feel its a burden for me to have Miss Montag as a
tenant but Miss Bürstner accepts her into her room with herself
Theres nothing there for you to worry about said K crushing the
remains of a sugar lump in his cup  Does she cause you any trouble?
No said Mrs Grubach in itself its very good to have her there it
makes another room free for me and I can let my nephew the captain
occupy it  I began to worry he might be disturbing you when I had to
let him live in the living room next to you over the last few days
Hes not very considerate  What an idea said K standing up
theres no question of that  You seem to think that because I cant
stand this toing and froing of Miss Montag that Im oversensitive 
and there she goes back again  Mrs Grubach appeared quite powerless
Should I tell her to leave moving the rest of her things over till
later then Mr K?  If thats what you want Ill do it immediately
But she has to move in with Miss Bürstner said K  Yes said Mrs
Grubach without quite understanding what K meant  So she has to take
her things over there  Mrs Grubach just nodded  K was irritated all
the more by this dumb helplessness which seen from the outside could
have seemed like a kind of defiance on her part  He began to walk up
and down the room between the window and the door thus depriving Mrs
Grubach of the chance to leave which she otherwise probably would have
hecho
        Just as K once more reached the door someone knocked at it  It
was the maid to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words
with Mr K and therefore requested that he come to the dining room
where she was waiting for him  K heard the maid out thoughtfully and
then looked back at the shocked Mrs Grubach in a way that was almost
contemptuous  His look seemed to be saying that K had been expecting
this invitation for Miss Montag for a long time and that it was
confirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday
morning from Mrs Grubachs tenants  He sent the maid back with the
reply that he was on his way then he went to the wardrobe to change his
coat and in answer to Mrs Grubachs gentle whining about the nuisance
Miss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast
things  But youve hardly touched it said Mrs Grubach  Oh just
take it away shouted K  It seemed to him that Miss Montag was mixed
up in everything and made it repulsive to him
        As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of
Miss Bürstners room  But it wasnt there that he was invited but the
dining room to which he yanked the door open without knocking
        The room was long but narrow with one window  There was only
enough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by
the door and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long
dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the
great window which was thus made almost inaccessible  The table was
already laid for a large number of people as on Sundays almost all the
tenants ate their dinner here at midday
        When K entered Miss Montag came towards him from the window
along one side of the table  They greeted each other in silence  Then
Miss Montag her head unusually erect as always said Im not sure
whether you know me  K looked at her with a frown  Of course I do
he said youve been living here with Mrs Grubach for quite some time
now  But I get the impression you dont pay much attention to whats
going on in the lodging house  said Miss Montag  No said K
Would you not like to sit down? said Miss Montag  In silence the two
of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down
facing each other  But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had
left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled
down the whole length of the room  When she came back the handbag
lightly swinging she said Id like just to have a few words with you
on behalf of my friend  She would have come herself but shes feeling
a little unwell today  Perhaps youll be kind enough to forgive her and
listen to me instead  Theres anyway nothing that she could have said
that I wont  On the contrary in fact I think I can say even more
than her because Im relatively impartial  Would you not agree? Qué
is there to say then? answered K who was tired of Miss Montag
continuously watching his lips  In that way she took control of what he
wanted to say before he said it  Miss Bürstner clearly refuses to
grant me the personal meeting that I asked her for  Thats how it
is said Miss Montag or rather thats not at all how it is the way
you put it is remarkably severe  Generally speaking meetings are
neither granted nor the opposite  But it can be that meetings are
considered unnecessary and thats how it is here  Now after your
comment I can speak openly  You asked my friend verbally or in
writing for the chance to speak with her  Now my friend is aware of
your reasons for asking for this meeting  or at least I suppose she is
 and so for reasons I know nothing about she is quite sure that it
would be of no benefit to anyone if this meeting actually took place
Moreover it was only yesterday and only very briefly that she made it
clear to me that such a meeting could be of no benefit for yourself
either she feels that it can only have been a matter of chance that
such an idea came to you and that even without any explanations from
her you will very soon come to realise yourself if you have not done
so already the futility of your idea  My answer to that is that
although it may be quite right I consider it advantageous if the
matter is to be made perfectly clear to give you an explicit answer  I
offered my services in taking on the task and after some hesitation my
friend conceded  I hope however also to have acted in your interests
as even the slightest uncertainty in the least significant of matters
will always remain a cause of suffering and if as in this case it can
be removed without substantial effort then it is better if that is done
without delay  I thank you said K as soon as Miss Montag had
finished  He stood slowly up looked at her then across the table
then out the window  the house opposite stood there in the sun  and
went to the door  Miss Montag followed him a few paces as if she did
not quite trust him  At the door however both of them had to step
back as it opened and Captain Lanz entered  This was the first time
that K had seen him close up  He was a large man of about forty with a
tanned fleshy face  He bowed slightly intending it also for K and
then went over to Miss Montag and deferentially kissed her hand  He was
very elegant in the way he moved The courtesy he showed towards Miss
Montag made a striking contrast with the way she had been treated by K
Nonetheless Miss Montag did not seem to be cross with K as it even
seemed to him that she wanted to introduce the captain  K however did
not want to be introduced he would not have been able to show any sort
of friendliness either to Miss Montag or to the captain the kiss on the
hand had for K bound them into a group which would keep him at a
distance from Miss Bürstner whilst at the same time seeming to be
totally harmless and unselfish  K thought however that he saw more
than that he thought he also saw that Miss Montag had chosen a means of
doing it that was good but twoedged  She exaggerated the importance
of the relationship between K and Miss Bürstner and above all she
exaggerated the importance of asking to speak with her and she tried at
the same time to make out that K was exaggerating everything  She
would be disappointed K did not want to exaggerate anything he was
aware that Miss Bürstner was a little typist who would not offer him
much resistance for long  In doing so he deliberately took no account
of what Mrs Grubach had told him about Miss Bürstner  All these things
were going through his mind as he left the room with hardly a polite
word  He wanted to go straight to his room but a little laugh from
Miss Montag that he heard from the dining room behind him brought him to
the idea that he might prepare a  surprise for the two of them the
captain and Miss Montag  He looked round and listened to find out if
there might be any disturbance from any of the surrounding rooms
everywhere was quiet the only thing to be heard was the conversation
from the dining room and Mrs Grubachs voice from the passage leading
to the kitchen  This seemed an opportune time K went to Miss
Bürstners room and knocked gently  There was no sound so he knocked
again but there was still no answer in reply  Was she asleep?  Or was
she really unwell?  Or was she just pretending as she realised it could
only be K knocking so gently?  K assumed she was pretending and
knocked harder eventually when the knocking brought no result he
carefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not
only improper but also pointless  In the room there was noone  Whats
more it looked hardly at all like the room K had known before
Against the wall there were now two beds behind one another there were
clothes piled up on three chairs near the door a wardrobe stood open
Miss Bürstner must have gone out while Miss Montag was speaking to him
in the dining room  K was not greatly bothered by this he had hardly
expected to be able to find Miss Bürstner so easily and had made this
attempt for little more reason than to spite Miss Montag  But that made
it all the more embarrassing for him when as he was closing the door
again he saw Miss Montag and the captain talking in the open doorway of
the dining room  They had probably been standing there ever since K
had opened the door they avoided seeming to observe K but chatted
lightly and followed his movements with glances the absent minded
glances to the side such as you make during a conversation  But these
glances were heavy for K and he rushed alongside the wall back into
his own room
Chapter Five
The whipman
        One evening a few days later K was walking along one of the
corridors that separated his office from the main stairway  he was
nearly the last one to leave for home that evening there remained only
a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch
department  when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had
himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a
junk room  He stood in amazement and listened again to establish
whether he might not be mistaken  For a while there was silence but
then came some more sighs  His first thought was to fetch one of the
servitors it might well have been worth having a witness present but
then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply
yank the door open  It was as he had thought a junk room  Old
unusable forms empty stone inkbottles lay scattered behind the
entrance  But in the cupboardlike room itself stood three men
crouching under the low ceiling  A candle fixed on a shelf gave them
light  What are you doing here? asked K quietly but crossly and
without thinking  One of the men was clearly in charge and attracted
attention by being dressed in a kind of dark leather costume which left
his neck and chest and his arms exposed  He did not answer  But the
other two called out Mr K  Were to be beaten because you made a
complaint about us to the examining judge  And now K finally
realised that it was actually the two policemen Franz and Willem and
that the third man held a cane in his hand with which to beat them
Well said K staring at them I didnt make any complaint I only
said what took place in my home  And your behaviour was not entirely
unobjectionable after all  Mr K said Willem while Franz clearly
tried to shelter behind him as protection from the third man if you
knew how badly we get paid you wouldnt think so badly of us  Ive got
a family to feed and Franz here wanted to get married you just have to
get more money where you can you cant do it just by working hard not
however hard you try  I was sorely tempted by your fine clothes
policemen arent allowed to do that sort of thing course they arent
and it wasnt right of us but its tradition that the clothes go to the
officers thats how its always been believe me; y es
understandable too isnt it what can things like that mean for anyone
unlucky enough to be arrested?  But if he starts talking about it openly
then the punishment has to follow  I didnt know about any of this
that youve been telling me and I made no sort of request that you be
punished I was simply acting on principle  Franz said Willem
turning to the other policeman didnt I tell you that the gentleman
didnt say he wanted us to be punished?  Now you can hear for yourself
he didnt even know wed have to be punished  Dont you let them
persuade you talking like that said the third man to K this
punishment is both just and unavoidable  Dont listen to him said
Willem interrupting himself only to quickly bring his hand to his mouth
when it had received a stroke of the cane were only being punished
because you made a complaint against us  Nothing would have happened to
us otherwise not even if theyd found out what wed done  Can you call
that justice?  Both of us me especially wed proved our worth as good
police officers over a long period  youve got to admit yourself that
as far as official work was concerned we did the job well  things
looked good for us we had prospects its quite certain that we
wouldve been made whipmen too like this one only he had the luck not
to have anyone make a complaint about him as you really dont get many
complaints like that  Only thats all finished now Mr K our careers
are at an end were going to have to do work now thats far inferior to
police work and besides all this were going to get this terrible
painful beating  Can the cane really cause so much pain then? preguntó
K testing the cane that the whipman swang in front of him  Were
going to have to strip off totally naked said Willem  Oh I see
said K looking straight at the whipman his skin was burned brown
like a sailors and his face showed health and vigour  Is there
then no possibility of sparing these two their beating? le preguntó
No said the whipman shaking his head with a laugh  Get
undressed he ordered the policemen  And to K he said You shouldnt
believe everything they tell you its the fear of being beaten its
already made them a bit weak in the head  This one here for instance
he pointed at Willem all that he told you about his career prospects
its just ridiculous  Look at him look how fat he is  the first
strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat   Do you know
what it is thats made him so fat?  Hes in the habit of everyone that
gets arrested by him he eats their breakfast  Didnt he eat up your
breakfast?  Yeah I thought as much  But a man with a belly like that
cant be made into a whipman and never will be that is quite out of
the question  There are whipmen like that Willem insisted who had
just released the belt of this trousers  No said the whipman
striking him such a blow with the cane on his neck that it made him
wince you shouldnt be listening to this just get undressed  I
would make it well worth your while if you would let them go said K
and without looking at the whipman again  as such matters are best
carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down  he pulled out his
wallet  And then youd try and put in a complaint against me too
said the whipman and get me flogged  No no  Now do be
reasonable said K if I had wanted to get these two punished I would
not now be trying to buy their freedom would I  I could simply close
the door here behind me go home and see or hear nothing more of it
But thats not what Im doing it really is of much more importance to
me to let them go free; if I had realised they would be punished or
even that they might be punished I would never have named them in the
first place as they are not the ones I hold responsible  Its the
organisation thats to blame the high officials are the ones to blame
Thats how it is shouted the policemen who then immediately received
another blow on their backs which were by now exposed  If you had a
senior judge here beneath your stick said K pressing down the cane
as he spoke to stop it being raised once more I really would do
nothing to stop you on the contrary I would even pay you money to give
you all the more strength  Yeah thats all very plausible what
youre saying there said the whipman only Im not the sort of
person you can bribe  Its my job to flog people so I flog them
Franz the policeman had been fairly quiet so far probably in
expectation of a good result from Ks intervention but now he stepped
forward to the door wearing just his trousers kneeled down hanging on
to Ks arm and whispered Even if you cant get mercy shown for both
of us at least try and get me set free  Willem is older than me hes
less sensitive than me in every way he even got a light beating a
couple of years ago but my records still clean I only did things the
way I did because Willem led me on to it hes been my teacher both for
good and bad  Down in front of the bank my poor bride is waiting for me
at the entrance Im so ashamed of myself its pitiful  His face was
flowing over with tears and he wiped it dry on Ks coat  Im not
going to wait any longer said the whipman taking hold of the cane in
both hands and laying in to Franz while Willem cowered back in a corner
and looked on secretly not even daring to turn his head  Then the
sudden scream that shot out from Franz was long and irrevocable it
seemed to come not from a human being but from an instrument that was
being tortured the whole corridor rang with it it must have been heard
by everyone in the building  Dont shout like that called out K
unable to prevent himself and as he looked anxiously in the direction
from which the servitor would come he gave Franz a shove not hard but
hard enough for him to fall down unconscious clawing at the ground with
his hands by reflex; he still did not avoid being hit; the rod still
found him on the floor; the tip of the rod swang regularly up and down
while he rolled to and fro under its blows  And now one of the
servitors appeared in the distance with another a few steps behind him
K had quickly thrown the door shut gone over to one of the windows
overlooking the yard and opened it  The screams had completely stopped
So that the servitor wouldnt come in he called out Its only me
Good evening chief clerk somebody called back  Is there anything
wrong?  No no answered K its only a dog yelping in the yard
There was no sound from the servitors so he added You can go back to
what you were doing  He did not want to become involved with a
conversation with them and so he leant out of the window  A little
while later when he looked out in the corridor they had already gone
Now K remained at the window he did not dare go back into the junk
room and he did not want to go home either  The yard he looked down
into was small and rectangular all around it were offices all the
windows were now dark and only those at the very top caught a reflection
of the moon  K tried hard to see into the darkness of one corner of the
yard where a few handcarts had been left behind one another He felt
anguish at not having been able to prevent the flogging but that was
not his fault if Franz had not screamed like that  clearly it must
have caused a great deal of pain but its important to maintain control
of oneself at important moments  if Franz had not screamed then it was
at least highly probable that K would have been able to dissuade the
whipman  If all the junior officers were contemptible why would the
whipman whose position was the most inhumane of all be any exception
and K had noticed very clearly how his eyes had lit up when he saw the
banknotes he had obviously only seemed serious about the flogging to
raise the level of the bribe a little And K had not been ungenerous
he really had wanted to get the policemen freed; if he really had now
begun to do something against  the degeneracy of the court then it was a
matter of course that he would have to do something here as well  But
of course it became impossible for him to do anything as soon as Franz
started screaming  K could not possibly have let the junior bank
staff and perhaps even all sorts of other people come along and catch
him by surprise as he haggled with those people in the junk room
Nobody could really expect that sort of sacrifice of him  If that had
been his intention then it would almost have been easier K would have
taken his own clothes off and offered himself to the whipman in the
policemens place  The whipman would certainly not have accepted this
substitution anyway as in that way he would have seriously violated his
duty without gaining any benefit  He would most likely have violated
his duty twice over as court employees were probably under orders not
to cause any harm to K while he was facing charges although there may
have been special conditions in force here  However things stood K
was able to do no more than throw the door shut even though that would
still do nothing to remove all the dangers he faced  It was regrettable
that he had given Franz a shove and it could only be excused by the
calor del momento
        In the distance he heard the steps of the servitors; no lo hizo
want them to be too aware of his presence so he closed the window and
walked towards the main staircase  At the door of the junk room he
stopped and listened for a little while  All was silent  The two
policemen were entirely at the whipmans mercy; he could have beaten
them to death  K reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it
suddenly back  He was no longer in any position to help anyone and the
servitors would soon be back;  he did though promise himself that he
would raise the matter again with somebody and see that as far as it
was in his power those who really were guilty the high officials whom
nobody had so far dared point out to him received their due punishment
As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank  he looked
carefully round at everyone who was passing but there was no girl to be
seen who might have been waiting for somebody not even within some
distance from the bank  Franzs claim that his bride was waiting for
him was thus shown to be a lie albeit one that was forgivable and
intended only to elicit more sympathy
        The policemen were still on Ks mind all through the following
day; he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his
office a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it
On the way home as he passed by the junk room again he opened its door
as if that had been his habit  Instead of the darkness he expected he
saw everything unchanged from the previous evening and did not know how
he should respond  Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it
when he had opened the door the previous evening   The forms and
bottles of ink just inside the doorway the whipman with his cane the
two policemen still undressed the candle on the shelf and the two
policemen began to wail and call out Mr K  K slammed the door
immediately shut and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would
shut it all the firmer  Almost in tears he ran to the servitors
working quietly at the copying machine  Go and get that junk room
cleared out he shouted and in amazement they stopped what they were
doing It should have been done long ago were sinking in dirt  They
would be able to do the job the next day K nodded it was too late in
the evening to make them do it there and then as he had originally
intended  He sat down briefly in order to keep them near him for a
little longer looked through a few of the copies to give the impression
that he was checking them and then as he saw that they would not dare
to leave at the same time as himself went home tired and with his mind
entumecido
Chapter Six
Ks uncle  Leni
        One afternoon  K was very busy at the time getting the post
ready  Ks Uncle Karl a small country land owner came into the room
pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some
papers   K had long expected his uncle to appear but the sight of him
now shocked K far less than the prospect of it had done a long time
before  His uncle was bound to come K had been sure of that for about
a month  He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle
would arrive slightly bowed his battered panama hat in his left hand
his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was
close enough as he rushed carelessly towards K knocking over everything
that was in his way  Ks uncle was always in a hurry as he suffered
from the unfortunate belief that he had a number of things to do while he
was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day  his
visits were only ever for one day  and at the same time thought he
could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that
might arise by chance  Uncle Karl was Ks former guardian and so K
was dutybound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed
for the night  Im haunted by a ghost from the country he would say
        As soon as they had greeted each other  K had invited him to sit
in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that  he said he wanted
to speak briefly with K in private  It is necessary he said with a
tired gulp it is necessary for my peace of mind   K immediately
sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let noone in
Whats this that Ive been hearing Josef? cried Ks uncle when they
were alone as he sat on the table shoving various papers under himself
without looking at them to make himself more comfortable  K said
nothing he knew what was coming but suddenly relieved from the effort
of the work he had been doing he gave way to a pleasant lassitude and
looked out the window at the other side of the street  From where he
sat he could see just a small triangular section of it part of the
empty walls of houses between two shop windows  Youre staring out the
window called out his uncle raising his arms For Gods sake Josef
give me an answer  Is it true can it really be true?  Uncle Karl
said K wrenching himself back from his daydreaming I really dont
know what it is you want of me  Josef said his uncle in a warning
tone as far as I know youve always told the truth  Am I to take
what youve just said as a bad sign?  I think I know what it is you
want said K obediently I expect youve heard about my trial
Thats right answered his uncle with a slow nod Ive heard about
your trial  Who did you hear it from then? asked K  Erna wrote to
me said his uncle she doesnt have much contact with you its true
you dont pay very much attention to her Im afraid to say but she
learned about it nonetheless  I got her letter today and of course I
came straight here  And for no other reason but it seems to me that
this is reason enough  I can read you out the part of the letter that
concerns you  He drew the letter out from his wallet  Here it is
She writes; I have not seen Josef for a long time I was in the bank
last week but Josef was so busy that they would not let me through; I
waited there for nearly an hour but then I had to go home as I had my
piano lesson  I would have liked to have spoken to him maybe there
will be a chance another time  He sent me a big box of chocolates for
my nameday that was very nice and attentive of him  I forgot to tell
you about it when I wrote and I only remember now that you ask me about
it  Chocolate as I am sure you are aware disappears straight away in
this lodging house almost as soon as you know somebody has given you
chocolate it is gone  But there is something else I wanted to tell you
about Josef  Like I said they would not let me through to see him at
the bank because he was negotiating with some gentleman just then
After I had been waiting quietly for quite a long time I asked one of
the staff whether his meeting would last much longer  He said it might
well do as it was probably about the legal proceedings he said that
were being conducted against him   I asked what sort of legal
proceedings it was that were being conducted against the chief clerk
and whether he was not making some mistake but he said he was not
making any mistake there were legal proceedings underway and even that
they were about something quite serious but he did not know any more
about it   He would have liked to have been of some help to the chief
clerk himself as the chief clerk was a gentleman good and honest but
he did not know what it was he could do and merely hoped there would be
some influential gentlemen who would take his side  Im sure that is
what will happen and that everything will turn out for the best in the
end but in the mean time things do not look at all good and you can
see that from the mood of the chief clerk himself  Of course I did not
place too much importance on this conversation and even did my best to
put the bank clerks mind at rest he was quite a simple man  I told
him he was not to speak to anyone else about this and I think it is all
just a rumour but I still think it might be good if you Dear Father
if you looked into the matter the next time you visit   It will be easy
for you to find out more detail and if it is really necessary to do
something about it through the great and influential people you know
But if it is not necessary and that is what seems most likely then at
least your daughter will soon have the chance to embrace you and I look
forward to it  Shes a good child said Ks uncle when he had
finished reading and wiped a few tears from his eyes  K nodded  With
all the different disruptions he had had recently he had completely
forgotten about Erna even her birthday and the story of the chocolates
had clearly just been invented so that he wouldnt get in trouble with
his aunt and uncle  It was very touching and even the theatre tickets
which he would regularly send her from then on would not be enough to
repay her  but he really did not feel now that it was right for him
to visit her in her lodgings and hold conversations with a little
eighteen year old schoolgirl  And what do you have to say about that?
asked his uncle who had forgotten all his rush and excitement as he read
the letter and seemed to be about to read it again  Yes Uncle said
K it is true  True called out his uncle What is true?  How can
this be true?  What sort of trial is it?  Not a criminal trial I hope?
Its a criminal trial answered K  And you sit quietly here while
youve got a criminal trial round your neck? shouted his uncle getting
ever louder  The more calm I am the better it will be for the
outcome said K in a tired voice dont worry  How can I help
worrying? shouted his uncle Josef my Dear Josef think about
yourself about your family think about our good name  Up till now
youve always been our pride dont now become our disgrace  I dont
like the way youre behaving he said looking at K with his head at
an angle thats not how an innocent man behaves when hes accused of
something not if hes still got any strength in him  Just tell me what
its all about so that I can help you  Its something to do with the
bank I take it?  No said K as he stood up and youre speaking
too loud Uncle I expect one of the staff is listening at the door and
I find that rather unpleasant  Its best if we go somewhere else then
I can answer all your questions as far as I can  And I know very well
that I have to account to the family for what I do  You certainly
do his uncle shouted Quite right you do  Now just get a move on
Josef hurry up now  I still have a few documents I need to prepare
said K and using the intercom he summoned his deputy who entered a
few moments later  Ks uncle still angry and excited gestured with
his hand to show that K had summoned him even though there was no need
whatever to do so  K stood in front of the desk and explained to the
young man who listened calm and attentive what would need to be done
that day in his absence speaking in a calm voice and making use of
various documents   The presence of Ks uncle while this was going on
was quite disturbing; he did not listen to what was being said  but at
first he stood there with eyes wide open and nervously biting his lips
Then he began to walk up and down the room stopped now and then at the
window or stood in front of a picture always making various
exclamations such as That is totally incomprehensible to me or Now
just tell me what are you supposed to make of that?  The young man
pretended to notice nothing of this and listened to Ks instructions
through to the end he made a few notes bowed to both K and his uncle
and then left the room  Ks uncle had turned his back to him and was
looking out the window bunching up the curtains with his outstretched
hands  The door had hardly closed when he called out At last  Now
that hes stopped jumping about we can go too  Once they were in the
front hall of the bank where several members of staff were standing
about and where just then the deputy director was walking across
there was unfortunately no way of stopping Ks uncle from continually
asking questions about the trial  Now then Josef he began lightly
acknowledging the bows from those around them as they passed tell me
everything about this trial; what sort of trial is it?  K made a few
comments which conveyed little information even laughed a little and
it  was only when they reached the front steps that he explained to his
uncle that he had not wanted to talk openly in front of those people
Quite right said his uncle but now start talking  With his head
to one side and smoking his cigar in short impatient draughts he
listened  First of all Uncle said K its not a trial like youd
have in a normal courtroom  So much the worse said his uncle
Hows that? asked K looking at him  What I mean is thats for the
worse he repeated  They were standing on the front steps of the bank;
as the doorkeeper seemed to be listening to what they were saying K
drew his uncle down further where they were absorbed into the bustle of
the street  His uncle took Ks arm and stopped asking questions with
such urgency about the trial they walked on for a while in silence
But how did all this come about? he eventually asked stopping
abruptly enough to startle the people walking behind who had to avoid
walking into him  Things like this dont come all of a sudden they
start developing a long time beforehand there must have been warning
signs of it why didnt you write to me?  You know Id do anything for
you to some extent I am still your guardian and until today thats
something I was proud of  Ill still help you of course I will only
now now that the trial is already underway it makes it very difficult
But whatever; the best thing now is for you to take a short holiday
staying with us in the country  Youve lost weight I can see that now
The country life will give you strength that will be good theres
bound to be a lot of hard work ahead of you  But besides that itll be
a way of getting you away from the court to some extent  Here theyve
got every means of showing the powers at their disposal and theyre
automatically bound to use them against you; in the country theyll
either have to delegate authority to different bodies or just have to
try and bother you by letter telegram or telephone  And thats bound
to weaken the effect it wont release you from them but itll give you
room to breathe  You could forbid me to leave said K who had been
drawn slightly into his uncles way of thinking by what he had been
saying  I didnt think you would do it said his uncle thoughtfully
you wont suffer too much loss of power by moving away  K grasped
his uncle under the arm to prevent him stopping still and said I
thought youd think all this is less important than I do and now youre
taking it so hard  Josef called his uncle trying to disentangle
himself from him so that he could stop walking but K did not let go
youve completely changed you used to be so astute are you losing it
now?  Do you want to lose the trial?  Do you realise what that would
mean?  That would mean you would be simply destroyed  And that everyone
you know would be pulled down with you or at the very least humiliated
disgraced right down to the ground  Josef pull yourself together  The
way youre so indifferent about it its driving me mad  Looking at you
I can almost believe that old saying: Having a trial like that means
losing a trial like that  My dear Uncle said K it wont do any
good to get excited its no good for you to do it and itd be no good
for me to do it  The case wont be won by getting excited and please
admit that my practical experience counts for something just as I have
always and still do respect your experience even when it surprises me
You say that the family will also be affected by this trial; I really
cant see how but thats beside the point and Im quite willing to
follow your instructions in all of this  Only I dont see any
advantage in staying in the country not even for you as that would
indicate flight and a sense of guilt  And besides although I am more
subject to persecution if I stay in the city I can also press the matter
forward better here  Youre right said his uncle in a tone that
seemed to indicate they were finally coming closer to each other I
just made the suggestion because as I saw it if you stay in the city
the case will be put in danger by your indifference to it and I thought
it was better if I did the work for you  But will you push things
forward yourself with all your strength if so that will naturally be
far better  Were agreed then said K  And do you have any
suggestions for what I should do next?  Well naturally Ill have to
think about it said his uncle you must bear in mind that Ive been
living in the country for twenty years now almost without a break you
lose your ability to deal with matters like this  But I do have some
important connections with several people who I expect know their way
around these things better than I do and to contact them is a matter of
course  Out there in the country Ive been getting out of condition
Im sure youre already aware of that  Its only at times like this
that you notice it yourself  And this affair of yours came largely
unexpected although oddly enough I had expected something of the sort
after Id read Ernas letter and today when I saw your face I knew it
with almost total certainty  But all that is by the by the important
thing now is we have no time to lose  Even while he was still
speaking Ks uncle had stood on tiptoe to summon a taxi and now he
pulled K into the car behind himself as he called out an address to the
driver  Were going now to see Dr Huld the lawyer he said we
were at school together  Im sure you know the name dont you? ¿No?
Well that is odd  Hes got a very good reputation as a defence
barrister and for working with the poor  But I esteem him especially as
someone you can trust  Its alright with me whatever you do said
K although he was made uneasy by the rushed and urgent way his uncle
was dealing with the matter  It was not very encouraging as the
accused be to taken to a lawyer for poor people  I didnt know he
said that you could take on a lawyer in matters like this  Well of
course you can said his uncle that goes without saying  Why
wouldnt you take on a lawyer?  And now so that Im properly instructed
in this matter tell me whats been happening so far  K instantly
began telling his uncle about what had been happening holding nothing
back  being completely open with him was the only way that K could
protest at his uncles belief that the trial was a great disgrace  He
mentioned Miss Bürstners name just once and in passing but that did
nothing to diminish his openness about the trial as Miss Bürstner had no
connection with it  As he spoke he looked out the window and saw how
just then they were getting closer to the suburb where the court
offices were  He drew this to his uncles attention but he did not
find the coincidence especially remarkable  The taxi stopped in front
of a dark building  Ks uncle knocked at the very first door at ground
level; while they waited he smiled showing his big teeth and
whispered Eight oclock; not the usual sort of time to be visiting a
lawyer but Huld wont mind it from me  Two large black eyes appeared
in the spyhatch in the door they stared at the two visitors for a
while and then disappeared; the door however did not open  K and his
uncle confirmed to each other the fact that they had seen the two eyes
A new maid afraid of strangers said Ks uncle and knocked again
The eyes appeared once more  This time they seemed almost sad but the
open gas flame that burned with a hiss close above their heads gave off
little light and that may have merely created an illusion  Open the
door called Ks uncle raising his fist against it we are friends
of Dr Huld the lawyer  Dr Huld is ill whispered someone behind
them  In a doorway at the far end of a narrow passage stood a man in
his dressing gown giving them this information in an extremely quiet
voice  Ks uncle who had already been made very angry by the long
wait turned abruptly round and retorted Ill? You say hes ill? y
strode towards the gentleman in a way that seemed almost threatening as
if he were the illness himself  Theyve opened the door for you now
said the gentleman pointing at the door of the lawyer  He pulled his
dressing gown together and disappeared  The door had indeed been
opened a young girl  K recognised the dark slightly bulging eyes 
stood in the hallway in a long white apron holding a candle in her
hand  Next time open up sooner said Ks uncle instead of a
greeting while the girl made a slight curtsey Come along Josef he
then said to K who was slowly moving over towards the girl Dr Huld
is unwell said the girl as Ks uncle without stopping rushed
towards one of the doors  K continued to look at the girl in amazement
as she turned round to block the way into the living room she had a
round face like a puppys not only the pale cheeks and the chin were
round but the temples and the hairline were too  Josef called his
uncle once more and he asked the girl Its trouble with his heart is
¿eso? I think it is sir said the girl who by now had found time to
go ahead with the candle and open the door into the room In one corner
of the room where the light of the candle did not reach a face with a
long beard looked up from the bed  Leni whos this coming in? preguntó
the lawyer unable to recognise his guests because he was dazzled by the
candle  Its your old friend Albert said Ks uncle  Oh Albert
said the lawyer falling back onto his pillow as if this visit meant he
would not need to keep up appearances  Is it really as bad as that?
asked Ks uncle sitting on the edge of the bed  I dont believe it
is  Its a recurrence of your heart trouble and itll pass over like
the other times  Maybe said the lawyer quietly but its just as
much trouble as its ever been  I can hardly breathe I cant sleep at
all and Im getting weaker by the day  I see said Ks uncle
pressing his panama hat firmly against his knee with his big hand
That is bad news  But are you getting the right sort of care? Y
its so depressing in here its so dark  Its a long time since I was
last here but it seemed to me friendlier then  Even your young lady
here doesnt seem to have much life in her unless shes just
pretending  The maid was still standing by the door with the candle;
as far as could be made out she was watching K more than she was
watching his uncle even while the latter was still speaking about her
K leant against a chair that he had pushed near to the girl  When
youre as ill as I am said the lawyer you need to have peace  I
dont find it depressing  After a short pause he added and Leni
looks after me well shes a good girl  But that was not enough to
persuade Ks uncle he had visibly taken against his friends carer
and even though he did not contradict the invalid he persecuted her
with his scowl as she went over to the bed put the candle on the
bedside table and leaning over the bed made a fuss of him by tidying
the pillows  Ks uncle nearly forgot the need to show any
consideration for the man who lay ill in bed he stood up walked up and
down behind the carer and K would not have been surprised if he had
grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed
K himself looked on calmly he was not even disappointed at finding the
lawyer unwell he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm
his uncle had developed for the matter he was glad that this enthusiasm
had now been distracted without his having to do anything about it  His
uncle probably simply wishing to be offensive to the lawyers
attendant then said Young lady now please leave us alone for a
while I have some personal matters to discuss with my friend  Dr
Hulds carer was still leant far over the invalids bed and smoothing
out the cloth covering the wall next to it she merely turned her head
and then in striking contrast with the anger that first stopped Ks
uncle from speaking and then let the words out in a gush she said very
quietly You can see that Dr Huld is so ill that he cant discuss any
matters at all  It was probably just for the sake of convenience that
she had repeated the words spoken by Ks uncle but an onlooker might
even have perceived it as mocking him and he of course jumped up as if
he had just been stabbed  You damned  in the first gurglings of
his excitement his words could hardly be understood K was startled
even though he had been expecting something of the sort and ran to his
uncle with the intention no doubt of closing his mouth with both his
hands  Fortunately though behind the girl the invalid raised himself
up Ks uncle made an ugly face as if swallowing something disgusting
and then somewhat calmer said We have naturally not lost our senses
not yet; if what I am asking for were not possible I would not be asking
for it  Now please go  The carer stood up straight by the bed
directly facing Ks uncle K thought he noticed that with one hand she
was stroking the lawyers hand  You can say anything in front of
Leni said the invalid in a tone that was unmistakably imploring
Its not my business said Ks uncle and its not my secrets  And
he twisted himself round as if wanting to go into no more negotiations
but giving himself a little more time to think Whose business is it
then? asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again
My nephews said Ks uncle and Ive brought him along with me
And he introduced him Chief Clerk Josef K  Oh said the invalid
now with much more life in him and reached out his hand towards K  Do
forgive me I didnt notice you there at all  Then he then said to his
carer Leni go stretching his hand out to her as if this were a
farewell that would have to last for a long time  This time the girl
offered no resistance  So you he finally said to Ks uncle who had
also calmed down and stepped closer you havent come to visit me
because Im ill but youve come on business  The lawyer now looked so
much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was
ill had somehow made him weak he remained supporting himself of one
elbow which must have been rather tiring and continually pulled at a
lock of hair in the middle of his beard  You already look much
better said Ks uncle now that that witch has gone outside He
interrupted himself whispered I bet you shes listening and sprang
over to the door  But behind the door there was noone Ks uncle came
back not disappointed as her not listening seemed to him worse than if
she had been but probably somewhat embittered  Youre mistaken about
her said the lawyer but did nothing more to defend her; perhaps that
was his way of indicating that she did not need defending  But in a
tone that was much more committed he went on As far as your nephews
affairs are concerned this will be an extremely difficult undertaking
and Id count myself lucky if my strength lasted out long enough for it;
Im greatly afraid it wont do but anyway I dont want to leave
anything untried; if I dont last out you can always get somebody else
To be honest this matter interests me too much and I cant bring
myself to give up the chance of taking some part in it  If my heart
does totally give out then at least it will have found a worthy affair
to fail in  K believed he understood not a word of this entire
speech he looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on
the bedside table with the candle in his hand a medicine bottle had
rolled off the table onto the floor he nodded to everything the lawyer
said agreed to everything and now and then looked at K urging him to
show the same compliance  Maybe Ks uncle had already told the lawyer
about the trial  But that was impossible everything that had happened
so far spoke against it  So he said
I dont understand   Well maybe Ive misunderstood what youve
been saying said the lawyer just as astonished and embarrassed as K
Perhaps Ive been going too fast  What was it you wanted to speak to
me about?  I thought it was to do with your trial  Of course it is
said Ks uncle who then asked K So what is it you want?  Yes but
how is it that you know anything about me and my case? asked K  Oh I
see said the lawyer with a smile  I am a lawyer I move in court
circles people talk about various different cases and the more
interesting ones stay in your mind especially when they concern the
nephew of a friend  Theres nothing very remarkable about that  What
is it you want then? asked Ks uncle once more You seem so uneasy
about it  You move in this courts circles? asked K  Yes said the
lawyer  Youre asking questions like a child said Ks uncle  What
circles should I move in then if not with members of my own
discipline? the lawyer added  It sounded so indisputable that K gave
no answer at all  But you work in the High Court not that court in
the attic he had wanted to say but could not bring himself to actually
utter it  You have to realise the lawyer continued in a tone as if
he were explaining something obvious unnecessary and incidental  you
have to realise that I also derive great advantage for my clients from
mixing with those people and do so in many different ways its not
something you can keep talking about all the time  Im at a bit of a
disadvantage now of course because of my illness but I still get
visits from some good friends of mine at the court and I learn one or
two things  It might even be that I learn more than many of those who
are in the best of health and spend all day in court  And Im receiving
a very welcome visit right now for instance  And he pointed into a
dark corner of the room  Where? asked K almost uncouth in his
surprise  He looked round uneasily; the little candle gave off far too
little light to reach as far as the wall opposite  And then something
did indeed begin to move there in the corner  In the light of the
candle held up by Ks uncle an elderly gentleman could be seen sitting
beside a small table  He had been sitting there for so long without
being noticed that he could hardly have been breathing  Now he stood up
with a great deal of fuss clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn
to him  It was as if by flapping his hands about like short wings he
hoped to deflect any introductions and greetings as if he wanted on no
account to disturb the others by his presence and seemed to be exhorting
them to leave him back in the dark and forget about his being there
That however was something that could no longer be granted him  You
took us by surprise you see said the lawyer in explanation
cheerfully indicating to the gentleman that he should come closer
which slowly hesitatingly looking all around him but with a certain
dignity he did  The office director  oh yes forgive me I havent
introduced you  this is my friend Albert K this is his nephew the
chief clerk Josef K and this is the office director  so the office
director was kind enough to pay me a visit  Its only possible to
appreciate just how valuable a visit like this is if youve been let
into the secret of what a pile of work the office director has heaped
over him  Well he came anyway we were having a peaceful chat as far
as I was able when Im so weak and although we hadnt told Leni she
mustnt let anyone in as we werent expecting anyone we still would
rather have remained alone but then along came you Albert thumping
your fists on the door the office director moved over into the corner
pulling his table and chair with him but now it turns out we might
have that is if thats what you wish we might have something to
discuss with each other and it would be good if we can all come back
together again   Office director   he said with his head on one
side pointing with a humble smile to an armchair near the bed  Im
afraid Ill only be able to stay a few minutes more smiled the office
director as he spread himself out in the armchair and looked at the
clock  Business calls  But I wouldnt want to miss the chance of
meeting a friend of my friend  He inclined his head slightly toward
Ks uncle who seemed very happy with his new acquaintance but he was
not the sort of person to express his feelings of deference and
responded to the office directors words with embarrassed but loud
laughter  A horrible sight  K was able to quietly watch everything as
nobody paid any attention to him the office director took over as
leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been
called forward the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his
ear his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of
driving away his new visitors Ks uncle served as candlebearer 
balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently
glanced nervously at it  and was soon free of his embarrassment and was
quickly enchanted not only by the office directors speaking manner but
also by the gentle waving handmovements with which he accompanied it
K leaning against the bedpost was totally ignored by the office
director perhaps deliberately and served the old man only as audience
And besides he had hardly any idea what the conversation was about and
his thoughts soon turned to the care assistant and the ill treatment she
had suffered from his uncle  Soon after he began to wonder whether he
had not seen the office director somewhere before perhaps among the
people who were at his first hearing  He may have been mistaken but
thought the office director might well have been among the old gentlemen
with the thin beards in the first row
        There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if
something of porcelain were being broken  Ill go and see whats
happened said K who slowly left the room as if giving the others the
chance to stop him  He had hardly stepped into the hallway finding his
bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door
when another small hand much smaller than Ks own placed itself on
his and gently shut the door  It was the carer who had been waiting
there  Nothing has happened she whispered to him I just threw a
plate against the wall to get you out of there   I was thinking about
you as well replied K uneasily  So much the better said the
carer  Come with me  A few steps along they came to a frosted glass
door which the carer opened for him  Come in here she said  It was
clearly the lawyers office fitted out with old heavy furniture as
far as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a
small rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big
windows  This way said the carer pointing to a dark trunk with a
carved wooden backrest  When he had sat down K continued to look
round the room it was a large room with a high ceiling the clients of
this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it  K thought he
could see the little steps with which visitors would approach the
massive desk  But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only
for the carer who sat very close beside him almost pressing him against
the armrest  I did think she said you would come out here to me by
yourself without me having to call you first  It was odd  First you stare
at me as soon as you come in and then you keep me waiting  And you
ought to call me Leni too she added quickly and suddenly as if no
moment of this conversation should be lost  Gladly said K  But as
for its being odd Leni thats easy to explain  Firstly I had to
listen to what the old men were saying and couldnt leave without a good
reason but secondly Im not a bold  person if anything Im quite shy
and you Leni you didnt really look like you could be won over in one
stroke either  Thats not it said Leni laying one arm on the
armrest and looking at K you didnt like me and I dont suppose you
like me now either  Liking wouldnt be very much said K
evasively  Oh she exclaimed with a smile thus making use of  Ks
comment to gain an advantage over him  So K remained silent for a
while  By now he had become used to the darkness in the room and was
able to make out various fixtures and fittings  He was especially
impressed by a large picture hanging to the right of the door he leant
forward in order to see it better  It depicted a man wearing a judges
robes; he was sitting on a lofty throne gilded in a way that shone forth
from the picture  The odd thing about the picture was that this judge
was not sitting there in dignified calm but had his left arm pressed
against the back and armrest his right arm however was completely
free and only grasped the armrest with his hand as if about to jump up
any moment in vigorous outrage and make some decisive comment or even to
pass sentence  The accused was probably meant to be imagined at the
foot of the steps the top one of which could be seen in the picture
covered with a yellow carpet  That might be my judge said K
pointing to the picture with one finger  I know him said Leni
looking up at the picture he comes here quite often  That picture is
from when he was young but he can never have looked anything like it
as hes tiny minute almost  But despite that he had himself made to
look bigger in the picture as hes madly vain just like everyone round
here  But even Im vain and that makes me very unhappy that you dont
like me  K replied to that last comment merely by embracing Leni and
drawing her towards him she lay her head quietly on his shoulder  To
the rest of it though he said What rank is he?  Hes an examining
judge she said taking hold of the hand with which K held her and
playing with his fingers  Just an examining judge once again said K
in disappointment the senior officials keep themselves hidden  But
here he is sitting on a throne  Thats all just made up said Leni
with her face bent over Ks hand really hes sitting on a kitchen
chair with an old horse blanket folded over it  But do you have to be
always thinking about your trial? she added slowly  No not at all
said K I probably even think too little about it  Thats not the
mistake youre making said Leni youre too unyielding thats what
Ive heard  Who said that? asked K he felt her body against his
chest and looked down on her rich dark tightlybound hair  Id be
saying too much if I told you that answered Leni  Please dont ask
for names but do stop making these mistakes of yours stop being so
unyielding theres nothing you can do to defend yourself from this
court you have to confess  So confess to them as soon as you get the
chance  Its only then that they give you the chance to get away not
till then  Only without help from outside even thats impossible but
you neednt worry about getting this help as I want to help you myself
You understand a lot about this court and what sort of tricks are
needed said K as he lifted her since she was pressing in much too
close to him onto his lap  Thats alright then she said and made
herself comfortable on his lap by smoothing out her skirt and adjusting
her blouse  Then she hung both her arms around his neck leant back and
took a long look at him  And what if I dont confess could you not
help me then? asked K to test her out  Im accumulating women to help
me he thought to himself almost in amazement first Miss Bürstner then
the court ushers wife and now this little care assistant who seems to
have some incomprehensible need for me  The way she sits on my lap as
if it were her proper place  No answered Leni slowly shaking her
head I couldnt help you then  But you dont want my help anyway it
means nothing to you youre too stubborn and wont be persuaded
Then after a while she asked Do you have a lover?  No said K
Oh you must have she said  Well I have really said K  Just
think Ive even betrayed her while Im carrying her photograph with
me  Leni insisted he show her a photograph of Elsa and then hunched
on his lap studied the picture closely  The photograph was not one
that had been taken while Elsa was posing for it it showed her just
after she had been in a wild dance such as she liked to do in wine bars
her skirt was still flung out as she span round she had placed her
hands on her firm hips and with her neck held taut looked to one side
with a laugh; you could not see from the picture whom her laugh was
intended for  Shes very tightly laced said Leni pointing to the
place where she thought this could be seen  I dont like her shes
clumsy and crude  But maybe shes gentle and friendly towards you
thats the impression you get from the picture  Big strong girls like
that often dont know how to be anything but gentle and friendly  Would
she be capable of sacrificing herself for you though?  No said K
she isnt gentle or friendly and nor would she be capable of
sacrificing herself for me  But Ive never yet asked any of those
things of her  Ive never looked at this picture as closely as you
You cant think much of her then said Leni She cant be your lover
after all  Yes she is said K Im not going to take my word back
on that  Well she might be your lover now then said Leni but you
wouldnt miss her much if you lost her or if you exchanged her for
somebody else me for instance  That is certainly conceivable said
K with a smile but she does have one major advantage over you she
knows nothing about my trial and even if she did she wouldnt think
about it  She wouldnt try to persuade me to be less unyielding  Well
thats no advantage said Leni  If shes got no advantage other than
that I can keep on hoping  Has she got any bodily defects?  Bodily
defects? asked K  Yeah said Leni as I do have a bodily defect
just a little one  Look  She spread the middle and ring fingers of
her right hand apart from each other  Between those fingers the flap of
skin connecting them reached up almost as far as the top joint of the
little finger  In the darkness K did not see at first what it was she
wanted to show him so she led his hand to it so that he could feel
What a freak of nature said K and when he had taken a look at the
whole hand he added What a pretty claw  Leni looked on with a kind
of pride as K repeatedly opened and closed her two fingers in
amazement until finally he briefly kissed them and let go  Oh she
immediately exclaimed you kissed me  Hurriedly and with her mouth
open she clambered up Ks lap with her knees  He was almost aghast as
he looked up at her now that she was so close to him there was a
bitter irritating smell from her like pepper she grasped his head
leant out over him and bit and kissed his neck even biting into his
hair  Ive taken her place she exclaimed from time to time  Just
look now youve taken me instead of her   Just then her knee slipped
out and with a little cry she nearly fell down onto the carpet K
tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down
with her  Now youre mine she said  Her last words to him as he
left were Heres the key to the door come whenever you want and she
planted an undirected kiss on his back  When he stepped out the front
door there was a light rain falling he was about to go to the middle of
the street to see if he could still glimpse Leni at the window when Ks
uncle leapt out of a car that K thinking of other things had not seen
waiting outside the building  He took hold of K by both arms and
shoved him against the door as if he wanted to nail him to it  Young
man he shouted how could you do a thing like that?  Things were
going well with this business of yours now youve caused it terrible
damage  You slip off with some dirty little thing who moreover is
obviously the lawyers beloved and stay away for hours  You dont even
try to find an excuse dont try to hide anything no youre quite open
about it you run off with her and stay there  And meanwhile were
sitting there your uncle whos going to such effort for you the lawyer
who needs to be won over to your side and above all the office
director a very important gentleman who is in direct command of your
affair in its present stage  We wanted to discuss how best to help you
I had to handle the lawyer very carefully he had to handle the office
director carefully and you had most reason of all to at least give me
some support  Instead of which you stay away  Eventually we couldnt
keep up the pretence any longer but these are polite and highly capable
men they didnt say anything about it so as to spare my feelings but in
the end not even they could continue to force themselves and as they
couldnt speak about the matter in hand they became silent  We sat
there for several minutes listening to see whether you wouldnt finally
come back  All in vain  In the end the office director stood up as he
had stayed far longer than he had originally intended made his
farewell looked at me in sympathy without being able to help he waited
at the door for a long time although its more than I can understand why
he was being so good and then he went  I of course was glad hed
gone Id been holding my breath all this time  All this had even more
affect on the lawyer lying there ill when I took my leave of him the
good man he was quite unable to speak  You have probably contributed
to his total collapse and so brought the very man who you are dependent
on closer to his death  And me your own uncle you leave me here in
the rain  just feel this Im wet right through  waiting here for
hours sick with worry
Chapter Seven
Lawyer  Manufacturer  Painter
        One winter morning  snow was falling in the dull light outside 
K was sitting in his office already extremely tired despite the early
hour  He had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work
and none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him so he
would not be disturbed by them at least  But instead of working he
turned round in his chair slowly moved various items around his desk
but then without being aware of it he lay his arm stretched out on the
desk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest
        He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his
head  He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work
out a written defence and hand it in to the court  It would contain a
short description of his life and explain why he had acted the way he
had at each event that was in any way important whether he now
considered he had acted well or ill and his reasons for each  There
was no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have
over relying on the lawyer who was anyway not without his shortcomings
K had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not
a lot it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him and
none of the previous discussions had given K the impression that this
man would be able to do much for him  Most importantly he had asked
him hardly any questions  And there were so many questions here to be
asked  Asking questions were the most important thing  K had the
feeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here
himself  The lawyer in contrast did not ask questions but did all the
talking himself or sat silently facing him leant forward slightly over
the desk probably because he was hard of hearing pulled on a strand of
hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet perhaps
at the very spot where K had lain with Leni  Now and then he would
give K some vague warning of the sort you give to children  His
speeches were as pointless as they were boring and K decided that when
the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them  Once the lawyer
thought he had humiliated K sufficiently he usually started something
that would raise his spirits again  He had already he would then say
won many such cases partly or in whole cases which may not really have
been as difficult as this one but which on the face of it had even
less hope of success  He had a list of these cases here in the drawer 
here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk  but
could unfortunately not show them to K as they dealt with official
secrets  Nonetheless the great experience he had acquired through all
these cases would of course be of benefit to K  He had of course
begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first
documents  They would be very important because the first impression
made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the
proceedings  Unfortunately though he would still have to make it
clear to K that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even
read by the court  They simply put them with the other documents and
point out that for the time being questioning and observing the
accused are much more important than anything written  If the applicant
becomes insistent then they add that before they come to any decision
as soon as all the material has been brought together with due regard
of course to all the documents then these first documents to have been
submitted will also be checked over  But unfortunately even this is
not usually true the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or
lost completely and even if they do keep them right to the end they are
hardly read although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour  This
is all very regrettable but not entirely without its justifications
But K should not forget that the trial would not be public if the
court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that
says it has to be  As a result the accused and his defence dont have
access even to the court records and especially not to the indictment
and that means we generally dont know  or at least not precisely 
what the first documents need to be about which means that if they do
contain anything of relevance to the case its only by a lucky
coincidence  If anything about the individual charges and the reasons
for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is
being questioned then its possible to work out and submit documents
that really direct the issue and present proof but not before
Conditions like this of course place the defence in a very
unfavourable and difficult position  But that is what they intend  In
fact defence is not really allowed under the law its only tolerated
and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the
law imply even that  So strictly speaking there is no such thing as a
counsel acknowledged by the court and anyone who comes before this
court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer  The
effect of all this of course is to remove the dignity of the whole
procedure the next time K is in the court offices he might like to
have a look in at the lawyers room just so that hes seen it  He
might well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there  The
room theyve been allocated with its narrow space and low ceiling will
be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people  The
only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up
that if you want to look out of it you first have to get one of your
colleagues to support you on his back and even then the smoke from the
chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face
black  In the floor of this room  to give yet another example of the
conditions there  there is a hole thats been there for more than a
year its not so big that a man could fall through but it is big
enough for your foot to disappear through it  The lawyers room is on
the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang
down into the first floor of the attic underneath it and right in the
corridor where the litigants are waiting  Its no exaggeration when
lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace  Complaints to the
management dont have the slightest effect but the lawyers are strictly
forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense  But even
treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons  They want as far as
possible to prevent any kind of defence everything should be made the
responsibility of the accused  Not a bad point of view basically but
nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are
not necessary for the accused in this court  On the contrary there is
no court where they are less needed than here  This is because
proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also
from the accused  Only as far as that is possible of course but it is
possible to a very large extent  And the accused doesnt get to see the
court records either and its very difficult to infer whats in the
court records from whats been said during questioning based on them
especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced
with every possible worry to distract him  This is when the defence
begins  Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present
while the accused is being questioned so afterwards and if possible
still at the door of the interview room he has to learn what he can
about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use even
though what the accused has to report is often very confused  But that
is not the most important thing as theres really not a lot that can be
learned in this way although in this as with anything else a
competent man will learn more than another  Nonetheless the most
important thing is the lawyers personal connections thats where the
real value of taking counsel lies  Now K will most likely have already
learned from his own experience that among its very lowest orders the
court organisation does have its imperfections the court is strictly
closed to the public but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes
do to some extent show where the gaps are This is where most lawyers
will push their way in this is where bribes are paid and information
extracted there have even in earlier times at least been incidents
where documents have been stolen  Theres no denying that some
surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in
this way for a limited time and these petty advocates then strut to
and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients but for the
further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing
good  The only things of real value are honest personal contacts
contacts with higher officials albeit higher officials of the lower
grades you understand  That is the only way the progress of the trial
can be influenced hardly noticeable at first its true but from then
on it becomes more and more visible  There are of course not many
lawyers who can do this and K has made a very good choice in this
matter  There were probably no more than one or two who had as many
contacts as Dr Huld but they dont bother with the company of the
lawyers room and have nothing to do with it  This means they have all
the less contact with the court officials  It is not at all necessary
for Dr Huld to go to the court wait in the anterooms for the
examining judges to turn up if they turn up and try to achieve
something which according to the judges mood is usually more apparent
than real and most often not even that  No K has seen for himself
that the court officials including some who are quite high up come
forward without being asked are glad to give information which is fully
open or at least easy to understand they discuss the next stages in the
proceedings in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite
willing to adopt the other persons point of view  However when this
happens you should never trust them too far as however firmly they may
have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they
might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the
court that says just the opposite and might well be even harder on the
defendant than the original view the one they insist theyve been fully
dissuaded from  And of course theres no way of defending yourself
from this something said in private is indeed in private and cannot
then be used in public its not something that makes it easy for the
defence to keep those gentlemens favour  On the other hand its also
true that the gentlemen dont become involved with the defence  which
will of course be done with great expertise  just for philanthropic
reasons or in order to be friendly in some respects it would be truer
to say that they too have it allocated to them  This is where the
disadvantages of a court structure that right from the start
stipulates that all proceedings take place in private come into force
In normal mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public
and theyre very well equipped for it but here they dont; normal
trials run their course all by themselves almost and just need a nudge
here and there; but when theyre faced with cases that are especially
difficult theyre as lost as they often are with ones that are very
simple; theyre forced to spend all their time day and night with
their laws and so they dont have the right feel for human
relationships and thats a serious shortcoming in cases like this
Thats when they come for advice to the lawyer with a servant behind
them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret  You
could have seen many gentlemen at this window gentlemen of whom you
would least expect it staring out this window in despair on the street
below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he
can give them good advice  And at times like that its also possible to
see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions
and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which its
just not in their natures to overcome  But theyre not in an easy
position to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an
injustice  The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are
endless and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always
tell whats going to happen  But even for the junior officials the
proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret so they are
hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed court affairs
appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they
come from and they move on further without their learning where they go
So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can
learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go
through the final verdict or the reasons for it  Theyre only allowed
to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them and
they usually know less about the results of their work after its left
them than the defence does even though the defence will usually stay in
contact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end so that
the court officials can learn many useful things from the defence
Bearing all this in mind does it still surprise K that the officials
are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in
unflattering ways  which is an experience shared by everyone  All the
officials are irritated even when they appear calm  This causes many
difficulties for the junior advocates of course  There is a story for
instance that has very much the ring of truth about it  It goes like
this: One of the older officials a good and peaceful man was dealing
with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused
especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers  He had been
studying it for a day and a night without a break  as these officials
are indeed hard working noone works as hard as they do  When it was
nearly morning and he had been working for twentyfour hours with
probably very little result he went to the front entrance waited there
in ambush and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would
throw him down the steps  The lawyers gathered together down in front
of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; sobre el
one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so
that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the
official and as Ive already mentioned they would have to be careful
not to set all the officials against them  On the other hand any day
not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some
importance to force their way inside  In the end they agreed that they
would try to tire the old man out  One lawyer after another was sent
out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again offering
what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance and his
colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps  That went on for
about an hour until the old gentleman who was already exhausted from
working all night was very tired and went back to his office  Those
who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first so
they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there
really was noone there and only then did they all gather together and
probably didnt even dare to complain as its far from being the
lawyers job to introduce any improvements in the court system or even
to want to  Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship
there to some extent but one significant point is that almost every
defendant even very simple people begins to think of suggestions for
improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun many of them
often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far
better elsewhere  The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal
with the situation as it is  Even if it were possible to improve any
detail of it  which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense  the
best that they could achieve although doing themselves incalculable
harm in the process is that they will have attracted the special
attention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future and
the officials are always ready to seek revenge  Never attract attention
to yourself  Stay calm however much it goes against your character
Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how to
some extent it remains in a state of suspension and that even if you
alter something in one place youll draw the ground out from under your
feet and might fall whereas if an enormous organism like the court is
disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for
itself somewhere else  Everything is connected with everything else and
will continue without any change or else which is quite probable even
more closed more attentive more strict more malevolent  So its best
to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them  It
doesnt do much good to make accusations especially if you cant make
it clear what theyre based on and their full significance but it must
be said that K caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his
behaviour towards the office director he was a very influential man but
now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do
anything for K  If the trial is mentioned even just in passing  its
quite obvious that hes ignoring it  These officials are in many ways
just like children  Often something quite harmless  although Ks
behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless  will leave them
feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends
of theirs they turn away when they see them and do everything they can
to oppose them  But then with no particular reason surprisingly
enough some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything
seemed so hopeless will make them laugh and theyll be reconciled
Its both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them and
theres hardly any reason for it  Its sometimes quite astonishing that
a single average life is enough to encompass so much that its at all
possible ever to have any success in ones work here  On the other
hand there are also dark moments such as everyone has when you think
youve achieved nothing at all when it seems that the only trials to
come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end
from the start and would do so without any help while all the others
are lost despite all the running to and fro all the effort all the
little apparent successes that gave such joy  Then you no longer feel
very sure of anything and if asked about a trial that was doing well by
its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted
in it would not even dare deny that  And even that is a kind of self
confidence but then its the only one thats left   Lawyers are
especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort  and they are
no more than fits of depression of course  when a case is suddenly
taken out of their hands after theyve been conducting it satisfactorily
for some time  Thats probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer
Its not that the accused takes the case away from him that hardly ever
happens once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay
with him whatever happens  How could he ever carry on by himself after
hes taken on help from a lawyer?  No that just doesnt happen but
what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the
lawyer may not go along with it  Client and trial are both simply taken
away from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials
wont help however good they are as they dont know anything
themselves  The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can
be given where its being processed in courts to which noone has any
access where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer  You
come home one day and find all the documents youve submitted which
youve worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for lying
on the desk theyve been sent back as they cant be carried through to
the next stage in the trial theyre just worthless scraps of paper  It
doesnt mean that the case has been lost not at all or at least there
is no decisive reason for supposing so its just that you dont know
anything more about the case and wont be told anything of whats
happening  Well cases like that are the exceptions Im glad to say
and even if Ks trial is one of them its still for the time being a
long way off  But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to
get to work and K could be sure they would be made use of  As he had
said the time for submitting documents was still in the future and
there was no rush to prepare them it was much more important to start
the initial discussions with the appropriate officials and they had
already taken place  With varying degrees of success it must be said
It was much better not to give away any details before their time as in
that way K could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be
raised or he might be made too anxious better just to say that some
individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very
willing to help although others have spoken less favourably but even
they have not in any way refused to help  So all in all the results
are very encouraging only you should certainly not draw any particular
conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it
was only the way they developed further that would show what the value
of these preliminary proceedings has been  Anyway nothing has been
lost yet and if we can succeed in getting the office director despite
everything on our side  and several actions have been undertaken to
this end  then everything is a clean wound as a surgeon would say and
we can wait for the results with some comfort
        When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite
tireless  He went through it all again every time K went to see him
There was always some progress but he could never be told what sort of
progress it was  The first set of documents to be submitted were being
worked on but still not ready which usually turned out to be a great
advantage the next time K went to see him as the earlier occasion would
have been a very bad time to put them in which they could not then have
known  If K stupefied from all this talking ever pointed out that
even considering all these difficulties progress was very slow the
lawyer would object that progress was not slow at all but that they
might have progressed far further if K had come to him at the right
time  But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still
further difficulties and not only where time was concerned  The only
welcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived
to bring the lawyer his tea while K was there  Then she would stand
behind K  pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his
cup poured the tea in and drank  and secretly let K hold her hand
There was always complete silence  The lawyer drank  K squeezed
Lenis hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke Ks hair
Still here are you? the lawyer would ask when he was ready  I
wanted to take the dishes away said Leni they would give each others
hands a final squeeze the lawyer would wipe his mouth and then start
talking at K again with renewed energy
        Was the lawyer trying to comfort K or to confuse him?  K could
not tell but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good
hands  Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right even though he
obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably
had never even taken on a case as important as he said Ks was  But it
was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his personal contacts
with the civil servants  Were they to be exploited solely for Ks
benefit?  The lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing only
with junior officials which meant officials who were dependent on
others and the direction taken in each trial could be important for
their own furtherment  Could it be that they were making use of the
lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction which would of course
always be at the cost of the defendant?  It certainly did not mean that
they would do that in every trial that was not likely at all and there
were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and all
the room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted as it would
also be to their advantage to keep his reputation intact  If that
really was their relationship how would they direct Ks trial which
as the lawyer had explained was especially difficult and therefore
important enough to attract great attention from the very first time it
came to court?  There could not be much doubt about what they would do
The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first
documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already
lasted several months and that according to the lawyer everything was
still in its initial stages which was very effective of course in
making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless  Then he could be
suddenly surprised with the verdict or at least with a notification
that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be
passed on to a higher office
        It was essential that K take a hand in it himself  On winters
mornings such as this when he was very tired and everything dragged
itself lethargically through his head this belief of his seemed
irrefutable  He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had
had earlier  If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy
for him to ignore it although it was also certain that in that case
the trial would never have arisen in the first place  But now his
uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer he had to take account
of his family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress
of the trial he himself had carelessly  with a certain inexplicable
complacency  mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about
it in ways he did not know his relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed
to be in trouble because of it  In short he no longer had any choice
whether he would accept the trial or turn it down he was in the middle
of it and had to defend himself  If he was tired then that was bad
        But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to  He
had been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank
in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone
now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that
possible for him to the trial and there was no doubt that it had to
turn out well  The most important thing if something was to be
achieved was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way
guilty  There was no guilt  The trial was nothing but a big piece of
business just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank
many times a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers
waiting in ambush for him as they usually did and these dangers would
need to be defended against  If that was to be achieved then he must
not entertain any idea of guilt whatever he did he would need to look
after his own interests as closely as he could  Seen in this way there
was no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very
soon at best that very evening  The lawyer had told him as he talked
to him that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a
great deal of harm but K could not tolerate any impediment to his
efforts where his trial was concerned and these impediments were
probably caused by the lawyer himself  But once he had shaken off the
lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and if
possible he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with
every day  It would of course not be enough if that was to be done
for K to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the
others  Day after day he himself or one of the women or somebody else
on his behalf would have to run after the officials and force them to
sit at their desks and study Ks documents instead of looking out on
the corridor through the grating  There could be no letup in these
efforts everything would need to be organised and supervised it was
about time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to
defend and make use of his rights
        But when K had the confidence to try and do all this the
difficulty of composing the documents was too much for him  Earlier
just a week or so before he could only have felt shame at the thought
of being made to write out such documents himself;  it had never entered
his head that the task could also be difficult  He remembered one
morning when already piled up with work he suddenly shoved everything
to one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his
thoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed  Perhaps he would
offer them to that slowwitted lawyer but just then the door of the
managers office opened and the deputydirector entered the room with a
loud laugh  K was very embarrassed although the deputydirector of
course was not laughing at Ks documents which he knew nothing about
but at a joke he had just heard about the stockexchange a joke which
needed an illustration if it was to be understood and now the deputy
director leant over Ks desk took his pencil from his hand and drew
the illustration on the writing pad that K had intended for his ideas
about his case
        K now had no more thoughts of shame the documents had to be
prepared and submitted  If as was very likely he could find no time
to do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night  If the
nights werent enough he would have to take a holiday  Above all he could
not stop half way that was nonsense not only in business but always and
everywhere  Needless to say the documents would mean an almost endless
amount of work  It was easy to come to the belief not only for those
of an anxious disposition that it was impossible ever to finish it
This was not because of laziness or deceit which were the only things
that might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it but because he did
not know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring
so that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole of
his life looking at them from all sides and checking and reconsidering
them  It was also a very disheartening job  It would have been more
suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired and
become senile  But now just when K needed to apply all his thoughts
to his work when he was still rising and already posed a threat to the
deputydirector when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted to
enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man this was the time he
had to start working out these documents  Once more he began to feel
resentment  Almost involuntarily only to put an end to it his finger
felt for the button of the electric bell in the anteroom  As he
pressed it he glanced up to the clock  It was eleven oclock two
hours he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and
his wits were of course even more dulled than they had been before
But the time had nonetheless not been wasted he had come to some
decisions that could be of value  As well as various pieces of mail
the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already
been waiting for K for some time  They were actually very important
clients of the bank who should not really have been kept waiting under
any circumstances  Why had they come at such an awkward time and why
the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking
was the industrious K using up the best business time for his private
affairs?  Tired from what had gone before and tired in anticipation of
what was to follow K stood up to receive the first of them
        He was a short jolly man a manufacturer who K knew well  He
apologised for disturbing K at some important work and K for his
part apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long
But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such
false intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if
he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs  Instead
he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets
spread them out in front of K explained several items corrected a
little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced
over it all and reminded K of a similar piece of business hed
concluded with him about a year before mentioning in passing that this
time there was another bank  spending great effort to get his business
and finally stopped speaking in order to learn Ks opinion on the
matter  And K had indeed at first been closely following what the
manufacturer was saying he too was aware of how important the deal was
but unfortunately it did not last he soon stopped listening nodded at
each of the manufacturers louder exclamations for a short while but
eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at the
bald head bent over the papers asking himself when the manufacturer
would finally realise that everything he was saying was useless  When
he did stop talking K really thought at first that this was so that he
would have the chance to confess that he was incapable of listening
Instead seeing the anticipation on the manufacturers face obviously
ready to counter any objections made he was sorry to realise that the
business discussion had to be continued  So he bent his head as if hed
been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers
now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures  The
manufacturer thought there must be some objection perhaps his figures
werent really sound perhaps they werent the decisive issue whatever
he thought the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began
once again moving very close to K to explain what the deal was all
about  It is difficult said K pursing his lips The only thing
that could offer him any guidance were the papers and the manufacturer
had covered them from his view so he just sank back against the arm of
the chair  Even when the door of the managers office opened and
revealed not very clearly as if through a veil the deputy director he
did no more than look up weakly  K thought no more about the matter
he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy directors
appearance and for him the effect was very pleasing; el fabricante
immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy
director although K would have liked to make him ten times livelier as
he feared the deputy director might disappear again  He need not have
worried the two gentlemen met each other shook each others hand and
went together over to Ks desk  The manufacturer said he was sorry to
find the chief clerk so little inclined to do business pointing to K
who under the view of the deputy director had bent back down over the
papers  As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made
some effort to gain and keep the deputy directors attention K felt as
if they were much bigger than they really were and that their
negotiations were about him  Carefully and slowly turning his eyes
upwards he tried to learn what was taking place above him took one of
the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was lay it on
the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level
of the two men himself  He had no particular plan in mind as he did
this but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished
preparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely
The deputy director had been paying all his attention to the
conversation and did no more than glance at the paper he did not read
what was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk
was not important for him he took it from Ks hand saying Thank you
Im already familiar with everything and lay it calmly back on the
desk  K gave him a bitter sideways look  But the deputy director did
not notice this at all or if he did notice it it only raised his
spirits he frequently laughed out loud one time he clearly embarrassed
the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him
immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on
himself and finally invited him into his office where they could bring
the matter to its conclusion  Its a very important matter said the
manufacturer  I understand that completely  And Im sure the chief
clerk   even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the
manufacturer  will be very glad to have us take it off his hands
This is something that needs calm consideration  But he seems to be
overburdened today there are even some people in the room outside
whove been waiting there for hours for him  K still had enough
control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his
friendly albeit stiff smile only at the manufacturer he made no other
retaliation bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on
his desk like a clerk and watched as the two gentlemen still talking
took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the managers office
In the doorway the manufacturer turned and said he wouldnt make his
farewell with K just yet he would of course let the chief clerk know
about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something
to tell him about
        At last K was by himself  It did not enter his head to show
anyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it
was that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the
manufacturer and for this reason he could not let anyone in to see
him not even the servitor  He went over to the window sat down on the
ledge beside it held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the
square outside  The snow was still falling the weather still had not
brightened up at all
        He remained a long time sitting in this way not knowing what it
actually was that made him so anxious only occasionally did he glance
slightly startled over his shoulder at the door to the outer room
where mistakenly he thought hed heard some noise  Noone came and
that made him feel calmer he went over to the wash stand rinsed his
face with cold water and his head somewhat clearer went back to his
place by the window  The decision to take his defence into his own
hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed  All
the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had
little basic affect on him he had observed it from afar as something
that was scarcely able to reach him directly when it suited him he
looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head
back again whenever he wanted  Now in contrast if he was to conduct
his defence himself he would have to devote himself entirely to the
court  for the time being at least  success would mean later on his
complete and conclusive liberation but if he was to achieve this he
would have to place himself to start with in far greater danger than
he had been in so far  If he ever felt tempted to doubt this then his
experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would
be quite enough to convince him of it  How could he have sat there
totally convinced of the need to do his own defence?  How would it be
later?  What would his life be like in the days ahead?  Would he find
the way through it all to a happy conclusion?  Did a carefully worked
out defence  and any other sort would have made no sense  did a
carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself
off from everything else as much as he could?  Would he survive that?
And how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank? Eso
involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could
probably prepare in a few days leave although it would have been great
temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time it was a
whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last  This
was an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into Ks life
        And was he supposed to be doing the banks work at a time like
this?  He looked down at his desk  Was he supposed to let people in to
see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this? Mientras
his trial trundled on while the court officials upstairs in the attic
room sat looking at the papers for this trial should he be worrying
about the business of the bank?  Did this not seem like a kind of
torture acknowledged by the court connected with the trial and which
followed him around?  And is it likely that anyone in the bank when
judging his work would take any account of his peculiar situation?  No
one and never  There were those who knew about his trial although it
was not quite clear who knew about it or how much  But he hoped rumours
had not reached as far as the deputy director otherwise he would
obviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K he would show
neither comradeship nor humaneness  And what about the director? Eso
was true that he was well disposed towards K and as soon as he heard
about the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make
it easier for him but he would certainly not devote himself to it  K
at one time had provided the counterbalance to what the deputy director
said but the director was now coming more and more under his influence
and the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the
director to strengthen his own power  So what could K hope for?  Maybe
considerations of this sort weakened his power of resistance but it was
still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearly
as it could be seen at that moment
        For no particular reason just to avoiding returning to his desk
for a while he opened the window  It was difficult to open and he had
to turn the handle with both his hands  Then through the whole height
and breadth of the window the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into
the room filling it with a slight smell of burning  A few flakes of
snow were blown in with it  Its a horrible autumn said the
manufacturer who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the
deputy director and now stood behind K  K nodded and looked uneasily
at the manufacturers briefcase from which he would now probably take
the papers and inform K of the result of his negotiations with the
deputy director  However the manufacturer saw where K was looking
knocked on his briefcase and without opening it said Youll be wanting
to hear how things turned out  Ive already got the contract in my
pocket almost  Hes a charming man your deputy director  hes got
his dangers though  He laughed as he shook Ks hand and wanted to
make him laugh with him  But to K it once more seemed suspicious that
the manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing
about his comments to laugh at  Chief clerk said the manufacturer
I expect the weathers been affecting your mood has it? Youre looking
so worried today   Yes said K raising his hand and holding the
temple of his head headaches worries in the family  Quite right
said the manufacturer who was always in a hurry and could never listen
to anyone for very long everyone has his cross to bear  K had
unconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the
manufacturer out but the manufacturer said Chief clerk theres
something else Id like to mention to you  Im very sorry if its
something thatll be a burden to you today of all days but Ive been to
see you twice already lately and each time I forgot all about it  If
I delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether  That
would be a pity as I think what Ive got to say does have some value
Before K had had the time to answer the manufacturer came up close to
him tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly Youve
got a trial going on havent you?  K stepped back and immediately
exclaimed Thats what the deputy directors been telling you  No
no said the manufacturer how would the deputy director know about
¿eso? And what about you? asked K already more in control of
himself  I hear things about the court here and there said the
manufacturer and that even applies to what it is that I wanted to tell
you about  There are so many people who have connections with the
court said K with lowered head and he led the manufacturer over to
his desk  They sat down where they had been before and the
manufacturer said Im afraid its not very much that Ive got to tell
you about  Only in matters like this its best not to overlook the
tiniest details  Besides I really want to help you in some way
however modest my help might be  Weve been good business partners up
till now havent we?  Well then  K wanted to apologise for his
behaviour in the conversation earlier that day but the manufacturer
would tolerate no interruption shoved his briefcase up high in his
armpit to show that he was in a hurry and carried on  I know about
your case through a certain Titorelli  Hes a painter Titorellis just
his artistic name I dont even know what his real name is  Hes been
coming to me in my office for years from time to time and brings little
pictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity
as hes hardly more than a beggar  And theyre nice pictures too
moorland landscapes and that sort of thing  Wed both got used to doing
business in this way and it always went smoothly  Only one time these
visits became a bit too frequent I began to tell him off for it we
started talking and I became interested how it was that he could earn a
living just by painting and then I learned to my amazement that his
main source of income was painting portraits  I work for the court
he said what court? said I  And thats when he told me about the
court  Im sure you can imagine how amazed I was at being told all
this  Ever since then I learn something new about the court every time
he comes to visit and so little by little I get to understand something
of how it works  Anyway Titorelli talks a lot and I often have to push
him away not only because hes bound to be lying but also most of all
because a businessman like me whos already close to breaking point
under the weight of his own business worries cant pay too much
attention to other peoples  But all thats just by the by  Perhaps 
this is what Ive been thinking  perhaps Titorelli might be able to
help you in some small way he knows lots of judges and even if he cant
have much influence himself he can give you some advice about how to get
some influential people on your side  And even if this advice doesnt
turn out to make all the difference I still think itll be very
important once youve got it  Youre nearly a lawyer yourself  Thats
what I always say Mr K the chief clerk is nearly a lawyer  Oh Im
sure this trial of yours will turn out all right  So do you want to go
and see Titorelli then?  If I ask him to hell certainly do everything
he possibly can  I really do think you ought to go  It neednt be
today of course just some time when you get the chance  And anyway 
I want to tell you this too   you dont actually have to go and see
Titorelli this advice from me doesnt place you under any obligation at
all  No if you think you can get by without Titorelli itll certainly
be better to leave him completely out of it  Maybe youve already got a
clear idea of what youre doing and Titorelli could upset your plans
No if thats the case then of course you shouldnt go there under any
circumstances  And it certainly wont be easy to take advice from a lad
like that  Still its up to you  Heres the letter of recommendation
and heres the address
        Disappointed K took the letter and put it in his pocket  Even
at best the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was
incomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the
manufacturer knowing about his trial and that the painter was spreading
the news about  It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer who
was already on his way to the door a few words of thanks  Ill go
there he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door
or as Im very busy at present Ill write to him perhaps he would
like to come to me in my office some time  I was sure youd find the
best solution said the manufacturer  Although I had thought youd
prefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and
talking about the trial here  And its not always a good idea to send
letters to people like Titorelli you dont know what might happen to
them  But youre bound to have thought everything through and you know
what you can and cant do  K nodded and accompanied the manufacturer
on through the anteroom  But despite seeming calm on the outside he
was actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write
to Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his
recommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with
Titorelli without delay but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any
worthwhile assistance he would not have delayed  But it was only the
manufacturers comment that made K realise what dangers that could lead
to  Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little? Si
it was possible that he might invite a questionable character into the
bank with a clear letter and ask advice from him about his trial
separated from the deputy director by no more than a door was it not
possible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he had
failed to see or that he was even running towards?  There was not always
someone beside him to warn him  And just now just when he would have
to act with all the strength he could muster now a number of doubts of
a sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affected
his own vigilance  The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out
his office work; were they now going to affect the trial too?  Now at
least he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have
intended to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank
        He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor
came up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who
were waiting on a bench in the anteroom  They had already been waiting
to see K for a long time  Now that the servitor was speaking with K
they had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity
to see K before the others  It had been negligent of the bank to let
them waste their time here in the waiting room but none of them wanted
to draw attention to this  Mr K  one of them was saying but K
had told the servitor to fetch his winter coat and said to the three of
them as the servitor helped him to put it on Please forgive me
gentlemen Im afraid I have no time to see you at present  Please do
forgive me but I have some urgent business to settle and have to leave
straight away  Youve already seen yourselves how long Ive been
delayed  Would you be so kind as to come back tomorrow or some time?
Or perhaps we could settle your affairs by telephone?  Or perhaps you
would like to tell me now briefly what its about and I can then give
you a full answer in writing  Whatever the best thing will be for you
to come here again   The gentlemen now saw that their wait had been
totally pointless and these suggestions of Ks left them so astounded
that they looked at each other without a word  Thats agreed then is
¿eso? asked K who had turned toward the servitor bringing him his hat
Through the open door of Ks office they could see that the snowfall
outside had become much heavier  So K turned the collar of his coat up
and buttoned it up high under his chin  Just then the deputy director
came out of the adjoining room smiled as he saw K negotiating with the
gentlemen in his winter coat and asked Are you about to go out?
Yes said K standing more upright I have to go out on some
business  But the deputy director had already turned towards the
gentlemen  And what about these gentlemen? he asked  I think
theyve already been waiting quite a long time  Weve already come to
an understanding said K  But now the gentlemen could be held back no
longer they surrounded K and explained that they would not have been
waiting for hours if it had not been about something important that had
to be discussed now at length and in private  The deputy director
listened to them for a short while he also looked at K as he held his
hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there and then he
said Gentlemen there is a very simple way to solve this  If you
would prefer it Ill be very glad to take over these negotiations
instead of the chief clerk  Your business does of course need to be
discussed without delay  We are businessmen like yourselves and know
the value of a businessmans time  Would you like to come this way?
And he opened the door leading to the anteroom of his own office
        The deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything
that K was now forced to give up  But was K not giving up more than
he absolutely had to?  By running off to some unknown painter with as
he had to admit very little hope of any vague benefit his renown was
suffering damage that could not be repaired  It would probably be much
better to take off his winter coat again and at the very least try to
win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next
room  If K had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office
looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own he
would probably even have made the attempt  As K somewhat agitated
approached the door the deputy director called out Oh youve still
not left  He turned his face toward him  its many deep folds seemed
to show strength rather than age  and immediately began once more to
search  Im looking for a copy of a contract he said which this
gentleman  insists you must have  Could you help me look for it do you
think?  K made a step forward but the deputy director said thank
you Ive already found it and with a big package of papers which
certainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of
the contract he turned and went back into his own office
        I cant deal with him right now K said to himself but once
my personal difficulties have been settled then hell certainly be the
first to get the effect of it and he certainly wont like it
Slightly calmed by these thoughts K gave the servitor who had already
long been holding the door to the corridor open for him the task of
telling the director when he was able that K was going out of the
bank on a business matter  As he left the bank he felt almost happy at
the thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business
por un momento
        He went straight to the painter who lived in an outlying part of
town which was very near to the court offices although this area was
even poorer the houses were darker the streets were full of dirt that
slowly blew about over the halfmelted snow   In the great gateway to
the building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open
a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door and as K
approached it a repulsive yellow steaming liquid shot out causing some
rats to scurry away into the nearby canal  Down by the staircase there
was a small child lying on its belly crying but it could hardly be
heard because of the noise from a metalworkshop on the other side of
the entrance hall drowning out any other sound  The door to the
workshop was open three workers stood in a circle around some piece of
work that they were beating with hammers  A large tin plate hung on the
wall casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the
workers lighting up their faces and their workaprons  K did no more
than glance at any of these things he wanted to get things over with
here as soon as possible to exchange just a few words to find out how
things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank  Even if
he had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on
his work at the bank for that day  On the third floor he had to slow
down his pace he was quite out of breath  the steps just like the
height of each floor were much higher than they needed to be and hed
been told that the painter lived right up in the attic  The air was
also quite oppressive there was no proper stairwell and the narrow
steps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small
high window here and there  Just as K paused for a while some young
girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs
laughing  K followed them slowly caught up with one of the girls who
had stumbled and been left behind by the others and asked her as they
went up side by side Is there a painter Titorelli who lives here?
The girl hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked jabbed him
with her elbow and looked at him sideways  Her youth and her bodily
defects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved  She
did not smile once but looked at K earnestly with sharp acquisitive
eyes  K pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked Do you know
Titorelli the painter?  She nodded and asked in reply  What dyou
want to see him for?  K thought it would be to his advantage quickly
to find out something more about Titorelli  I want to have him paint
my portrait he said  Paint your portrait? she asked opening her
mouth too wide and lightly hitting K with her hand as if he had said
something extraordinarily surprising or clumsy with both hands she
lifted her skirt which was already very short and as fast as she
could she ran off after the other girls whose indistinct shouts lost
themselves in the heights  At the next turn of the stairs however K
encountered all the girls once more  The hunchbacked girl had clearly
told them about Ks intentions and they were waiting for him  They
stood on both sides of the stairs pressing themselves against the wall
so that K could get through between them and smoothed their aprons
down with their hands  All their faces even in this guard of honour
showed a mixture of childishness and depravity  Up at the head of the
line of girls who now laughing began to close in around K was the
hunchback who had taken on the role of leader  It was thanks to her
that K found the right direction without delay  he would have
continued up the stairs straight in front of him but she showed him
that to reach Titorelli he would need to turn off to one side
The steps that led up to the painter were especially narrow very long
without any turning the whole length could be seen in one glance and
at the top at Titorellis closed door it came to its end   This door
was much better illuminated than the rest of the stairway by the light
from a small skylight set obliquely above it it had been put together
from unpainted planks of wood and the name Titorelli was painted on it
in broad red brushstrokes  K was no more than half way up the steps
accompanied by his retinue of girls when clearly the result of the
noise of all those footsteps the door opened slightly and in the crack
a man who seemed to be dressed in just his nightshirt appeared  Oh
he cried when he saw the approaching crowd and vanished  The
hunchbacked girl clapped her hands in glee and the other girls crowded
in behind K to push him faster forward
        They still had not arrived at the top however when the painter
up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and with a deep bow
invited K to enter  The girls on the other hand he tried to keep
away he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him
and however much they tried to get in  if they could not get in with
his permission they would try to force their way in against his will
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under
his outstretched arm but the painter chased after her grabbed her by
the skirt span her once round and set her down again by the door with
the other girls who unlike the first had not dared to cross the
doorstep while the painter had left his post   K did not know what he
was to make of all this as they all seemed to be having fun  One
behind the other the girls by the door stretched their necks up high
and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but
which K did not understand and even the painter laughed as the
hunchback whirled round in his hand  Then he shut the door bowed once
more to K offered him his hand and introduced himself saying
Titorelli painter  K pointed to the door behind which the girls
were whispering and said You seem to be very popular in this
building  Ach those brats said the painter trying in vain to
fasten his nightshirt at the neck  He was also barefooted and apart
from that was wearing nothing more than a loose pair of yellowish linen
trousers held up with a belt whose free end whipped to and fro  Those
kids are a real burden for me he continued  The top button of his
nightshirt came off and he gave up trying to fasten it fetched a chair
for K and made him sit down on it  I painted one of them once  shes
not here today  and ever since then theyve been following me about
If Im here they only come in when I allow it but as soon as Ive gone
out theres always at least one of them in here  They had a key made to
my door and lend it round to each other  Its hard to imagine what a
pain that is  Suppose I come back home with a lady Im going to paint
I open the door with my own key and find the hunchback there or
something by the table painting her lips red with my paintbrush and
meanwhile her little sisters will be keeping guard for her moving about
and causing chaos in every corner of the room  Or else like happened
yesterday I might come back home late in the evening  please forgive
my appearance and the room being in a mess it is to do with them  so
I might come home late in the evening and want to go to bed then I feel
something pinching my leg look under the bed and pull another of them
out from under it  I dont know why it is they bother me like this I
expect youve just seen that I do nothing to encourage them to come near
me  And they make it hard for me to do my work too of course  If I
didnt get this studio for nothing Id have moved out a long time ago
Just then a little voice tender and anxious called out from under the
door Titorelli can we come in now?  No answered the painter
Not even just me by myself? the voice asked again  Not even just
you said the painter as he went to the door and locked it
        Meanwhile K had been looking round the room if it had not been
pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched
little room could be called a studio  It was hardly long enough or
broad enough to make two steps  Everything floor walls and ceiling
was made of wood between the planks narrow gaps could be seen  Across
from where K was the bed stood against the wall under a covering of
many different colours  In the middle of the room a picture stood on an
easel covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground
Behind K was the window through which the fog made it impossible to see
further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building
        The turning of the key in the lock reminded K that he had not
wanted to stay too long  So he drew the manufacturers letter out from
his pocket held it out to the painter and said I learned about you
from this gentleman an acquaintance of yours and its on  his advice
that Ive come here  The painter glanced through the letter and threw
it down onto the bed  If the manufacturer had not said very clearly
that Titorelli was an acquaintance of his a poor man who was dependent
on his charity then it would really have been quite possible to believe
that Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember
him  This impression was augmented by the painters asking Were you
wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?
K looked at the painter in astonishment  What did the letter actually
say?  K had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had
explained to the painter in his letter that K wanted nothing more with
him than to find out more about his trial  He had been far too rash in
coming here  But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer
and glancing at the easel said Are you working on a picture
currently?  Yes said the painter and he took the shirt hanging over
the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter  Its a portrait
Quite a good piece of work although its not quite finished yet  This
was a convenient coincidence for K it gave him a good opportunity to
talk about the court as the picture showed very clearly a judge
Whats more it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyers
office although this one showed a quite different judge a heavy man
with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides
far up the mans cheeks  The lawyers picture was also an oil painting
whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and
unclear  But everything else about the picture was similar as this
judge too was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed
ominously about to rise from it  At first K was about to say He
certainly is a judge but he held himself back for the time being and
went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail  There
was a large figure shown in middle of the thrones back rest which K
could not understand and asked the painter about it  Thatll need some
more work done on it the painter told him and taking a pastel crayon
from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but
without making it any clearer as far as K could make out  Thats the
figure of justice said the painter finally  Now I see said K
heres the blindfold and here are the scales  But arent those wings
on her heels and isnt she moving?  Yes said the painter I had to
paint it like that according to the contract  Its actually the figure
of justice and the goddess of victory all in one  That is not a good
combination said K with a smile  Justice needs to remain still
otherwise the scales will move about and it wont be possible to make a
just verdict  Im just doing what the client wanted said the
painter  Yes certainly said K who had not meant to criticise
anyone by that comment  Youve painted the figure as it actually
appears on the throne  No  said the painter Ive never seen that
figure or that throne its all just invention but they told me what it
was I had to paint  Hows that? asked K pretending not fully to
understand what the painter said  That is a judge sitting on the
judges chair isnt it?  Yes said the painter but that judge
isnt very high up and hes never sat on any throne like that  And he
has himself painted in such a grand pose?  Hes sitting there just like
the president of the court  Yeah gentlemen like this are very vain
said the painter  But they have permission from higher up to get
themselves painted like this  Its laid down quite strictly just what
sort of portrait each of them can get for himself  Only its a pity
that you cant make out the details of his costume and pose in this
picture pastel colours arent really suitable for showing people like
this  Yes said K it does seem odd that its in pastel colours
Thats what the judge wanted said the painter its meant to be for
a woman  The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like
working he rolled up his shirtsleeves picked up a few of the crayons
and K watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge
under their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture
This shadow play slowly surrounded the head like a decoration or lofty
distinction  But around the figure of Justice apart from some
coloration that was barely noticeable it remained light and in this
brightness the figure seemed to shine forward so that it now looked like
neither the God of Justice nor the God of Victory it seemed now
rather to be a perfect depiction of the God of the Hunt  K found the
painters work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he
reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything
relevant to his own affair  Whats the name of this judge? preguntó
suddenly  Im not allowed to tell you that the painter answered  He
was bent deeply over the picture and clearly neglecting his guest who
at first he had received with such care  K took this to be just a
foible of the painters and it irritated him as it made him lose time
I take it you must be a trustee of the court he said  The painter
immediately put his crayons down stood upright rubbed his hands
together and looked at K with a smile  Always straight out with the
truth he said You want to learn something about the court like it
says in your letter of recommendation but then you start talking about
my pictures to get me on your side  Still I wont hold it against you
you werent to know that that was entirely the wrong thing to try with
me Oh please he said sharply repelling Ks attempt to make some
objection  He then continued And besides youre quite right in your
comment that Im a trustee of the court  He made a pause as if
wanting to give K the time to come to terms with this fact  The girls
could once more be heard from behind the door  They were probably
pressed around the keyhole perhaps they could even see into the room
through the gaps in the planks  K forewent the opportunity to excuse
himself in some way as he did not wish to distract the painter from what
he was saying or else perhaps he didnt want him to get too far above
himself and in this way make himself to some extent unattainable so he
asked Is that a publicly acknowledged position?  No was the
painters curt reply as if the question prevented him saying any more
But K wanted him to continue speaking and said Well positions like
that that arent officially acknowledged can often have more influence
than those that are  And thats how it is with me said the painter
and nodded with a frown  I was talking about your case with the
manufacturer yesterday and he asked me if I wouldnt like to help you
and I answered: He can come and see me if he likes and now Im
pleased to see you here so soon  This business seems to be quite
important to you and of course Im not surprised at that  Would you
not like to take your coat off now?  K had intended to stay for only a
very short time but the painters invitation was nonetheless very
welcome  The air in the room had slowly become quite oppressive for
him he had several times looked in amazement at a small iron stove in
the corner that certainly could not have been lit the heat of the room
was inexplicable  As he took off his winter overcoat and also
unbuttoned his frock coat the painter said to him in apology I must
have warmth  And it is very cosy here isnt it  This rooms very good
in that respect  K made no reply but it was actually not the heat
that made him uncomfortable but much more the stuffiness the air that
almost made it more difficult to breathe the room had probably not been
ventilated for a long time  The unpleasantness of this was made all the
stronger for K when the painter invited him to sit on the bed while he
himself sat down on the only chair in the room in front of the easel
The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K remained at the edge of
the bed and urged K to make himself comfortable and as he hesitated he
went over to the bed himself and pressed K deep down into the
bedclothes and pillows  Then he went back to his seat and at last he
asked his first objective question which made K forget everything
else  Youre innocent are you? he asked  Yes said K  He felt a
simple joy at answering this question especially as the answer was
given to a private individual and therefore would have no consequences
Up till then noone had asked him this question so openly  To make the
most of his pleasure he added I am totally innocent  So said the
painter and he lowered his head and seemed to be thinking  Suddenly he
raised his head again and said Well if youre innocent its all very
simple  K began to scowl this supposed trustee of the court was
talking like an ignorant child  My being innocent does not make things
simple said K  Despite everything he couldnt help smiling and
slowly shook his head  There are many fine details in which the court
gets lost but in the end it reaches into some place where originally
there was nothing and pulls enormous guilt out of it  Yeah yeah
sure said the painter as if K had been disturbing his train of
thought for no reason  But you are innocent arent you?  Well of
course I am said K  Thats the main thing said the painter  There
was no counterargument that could influence him but although he had
made up his mind it was not clear whether he was talking this way
because of conviction or indifference  K then wanted to find out and
said therefore Im sure youre more familiar with the court than I am
I know hardly more about it than what Ive heard and thats been from
many very different people  But they were all agreed on one thing and
that was that when ill thoughtout accusations are made they are not
ignored and that once the court has made an accusation it is convinced
of the guilt of the defendant and its very hard to make it think
otherwise  Very hard? the painter asked throwing one hand up in the
air  Its impossible to make it think otherwise  If I painted all the
judges next to each other here on canvas and you were trying to defend
yourself in front of it youd have more success with them than youd
ever have with the real court  Yes said K to himself forgetting
that he had only gone there to investigate the painter
        One of the girls behind the door started up again and asked
Titorelli is he going to go soon?  Quiet shouted the painter at
the door Cant you see Im talking with the gentleman?  But this was
not enough to satisfy the girl and she asked You going to paint his
picture?  And when the painter didnt answer she added Please dont
paint him hes an orrible bloke  There followed an incomprehensible
interwoven babble of shouts and replies and calls of agreement  The
painter leapt over to the door opened it very slightly  the girls
clasped hands could be seen stretching through the crack as if they
wanted something  and said If youre not quiet Ill throw you all
down the stairs  Sit down here on the steps and be quiet  They
probably did not obey him immediately so that he had to command Down
on the steps  Only then it became quiet
        Im sorry about that said the painter as he returned to K  K
had hardly turned towards the door he had left it completely up to the
painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he
wanted to  Even now he made hardly any movement as the painter bent
over him and whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside
said These girls belong to the court as well  Hows that? preguntó
K as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter  But the
painter sat back down on his chair and half in jest half in
explanation Well everything belongs to the court  That is
something I had never noticed until now said K curtly this general
comment of the painters made his comment about the girls far less
disturbing  Nonetheless K looked for a while at the door behind
which the girls were now sitting quietly on the steps  Except that one
of them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks
and was moving it slowly up and down  You still dont seem to have
much general idea of what the courts about said the painter who had
stretched his legs wide apart and was tapping loudly on the floor with
the tip of his foot But as youre innocent you wont need it anyway
Ill get you out of this by myself  How do you intend to do that?
asked K  You did say yourself not long ago that its quite impossible
to go to the court with reasons and proofs  Only impossible for
reasons and proofs you take to the court yourself  said the painter
raising his forefinger as if K had failed to notice a fine distinction
It goes differently if you try to do something behind the public court
thats to say in the consultation rooms in the corridors or here for
instance in my studio  K now began to find it far easier to believe
what the painter was saying or rather it was largely in agreement with
what he had also been told by others  In fact it was even quite
promising  If it really was so easy to influence the judges through
personal contacts as the lawyer had said then the painters contacts
with these vain judges was especially important and at the very least
should not be undervalued  And the painter would fit in very well in
the circle of assistants that K was slowly gathering around himself
He had been noted at the bank for his talent in organising here where
he was placed entirely on his own resources would be a good opportunity
to test that talent to its limits  The painter observed the effect his
explanation had had on K and then with a certain unease said Does
it not occur to you that the way Im speaking is almost like a lawyer?
Its the incessant contact with the gentlemen of the court has that
influence on me  I gain a lot by it of course but I lose a lot
artistically speaking   How did you first come into contact with the
judges then? asked K he wanted first to gain the painters trust
before he took him into his service  That was very easy said the
painter I inherited these contacts  My father was court painter
before me  Its a position thats always inherited  They cant use new
people for it the rules governing how the various grades of officials
are painted are so many and varied and above all so secret that no
one outside of certain families even knows them  In the drawer there
for instance Ive got my fathers notes which I dont show to anyone
But youre only able to paint judges if you know what they say
Although even if I lost them noone could ever dispute my position
because of all the rules I just carry round in my head  All the judges
want to be painted like the old great judges were and Im the only one
who can do that  You are to be envied said K thinking of his
position at the bank  Your position is quite unassailable then?
Yes quite unassailable said the painter and he raised his shoulders
in pride Thats how I can even afford to help some poor man facing
trial now and then  And how do you do that? asked K as if the
painter had not just described him as a poor man  The painter did not
let himself be distracted but said In your case for instance as
youre totally innocent this is what Ill do  The repeated mention of
Ks innocence was becoming irksome to him  It sometimes seemed to him
as if the painter was using these comments to make a favourable outcome
to the trial a precondition for his help which of course would make the
help itself unnecessary  But despite these doubts K forced himself not
to interrupt the painter  He did not want to do without the painters
help that was what he had decided and this help did not seem in any
way less questionable than that of the lawyer  K valued the painters
help far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more
harmless and open
        The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in
a subdued voice: I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you
want?  There are three possibilities; absolute acquittal apparent
acquittal and deferment  Absolute acquittal is the best of course
only theres nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome  I dont
think theres anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute
acquittal  Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused
is innocent  As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you
could depend on your innocence alone  In that case you wont need me or
any other kind of help
        At first K was astonished at this orderly explanation but then
just as quietly as the painter he said I think youre contradicting
yourself  Hows that? asked the painter patiently leaning back with
a smile  This smile made K feel as if he were examining not the words
of the painter but seeking out inconsistencies in the procedures of the
court itself  Nonetheless he continued unabashed and said You
remarked earlier that the court cannot be approached with reasoned
proofs you later restricted this to the open court and now you go so
far as to say that an innocent man needs no assistance in court  That
entails a contradiction  Moreover you said earlier that the judges can
be influenced personally but now you insist that an absolute acquittal
as you call it can never be attained through personal influence  That
entails a second contradiction  Its quite easy to clear up these
contradictions said the painter  Were talking about two different
things here theres what it says in the law and theres what I know
from my own experience you shouldnt get the two confused  Ive never
seen it in writing but the law does of course say on the one hand
that the innocent will be set free but on the other hand it doesnt say
that the judges can be influenced  But in my experience its the other
way round  I dont know of any absolute acquittals but I do know of
many times when a judge has been influenced  Its possible of course
that there was no innocence in any of the cases I know about  But is
that likely?  Not a single innocent defendant in so many cases?  When I
was a boy I used to listen closely to my father when he told us about
court cases at home and the judges that came to his studio talked about
the court in our circles nobody talks about anything else; I hardly
ever got the chance to go to court myself but always made use of it when
I could Ive listened to countless trials at important stages in their
development Ive followed them closely as far as they could be
followed and I have to say that Ive never seen a single acquittal
So  Not a single acquittal said K as if talking to himself and his
hopes  That confirms the impression I already have of the court  So
theres no point in it from this side either  They could replace the
whole court with a single hangman  You shouldnt generalise said
the painter dissatisfied Ive only been talking about my own
experience  Well thats enough said K or have you heard of any
acquittals that happened earlier?  They say there have been some
acquittals earlier the painter answered but its very hard to be
sure about it  The courts dont make their final conclusions public
not even the judges are allowed to know about them so that all we know
about these earlier cases are just legends  But most of them did
involve absolute acquittals you can believe that but they cant be
proved  On the other hand you shouldnt forget all about them either
Im sure there is some truth to them and they are very beautiful Ive
painted a few pictures myself depicting these legends  My assessment
will not be altered by mere legends said K  I dont suppose its
possible to cite these legends in court is it?  The painter laughed
No you cant cite them in court he said  Then theres no point in
talking about them said K he wanted for the time being to accept
anything the painter told him even if he thought it unlikely or
contradicted what he had been told by others  He did not now have the
time to examine the truth of everything the painter said or even to
disprove it he would have achieved as much as he could if the painter
would help him in any way even if his help would not be decisive  As a
result he said So lets pay no more attention to absolute acquittal
but you mentioned two other possibilities  Apparent acquittal and
deferment  Theyre the only possibilities said the painter  But
before we talk about them would you not like to take your coat off?
You must be hot  Yes said K who until then had paid attention to
nothing but the painters explanations but now that he had had the heat
pointed out to him his brow began to sweat heavily  Its almost
unbearable  The painter nodded as if he understood Ks discomfort
very well  Could we not open the window? asked K  No said the
painter  Its only a fixed pane of glass it cant be opened  K now
realised that all this time he had been hoping the painter would
suddenly go over to the window and pull it open  He had prepared
himself even for the fog that he would breathe in through his open
mouth  The thought that here he was entirely cut off from the air made
him feel dizzy  He tapped lightly on the bedspread beside him and with
a weak voice said That is very inconvenient and unhealthy  Oh no
said the painter in defence of his window as it cant be opened this
room retains the heat better than if the window were double glazed even
though its only a single pane  Theres not much need to air the room
as theres so much ventilation through the gaps in the wood but when I
do want to I can open one of my doors or even both of them  K was
slightly consoled by this explanation and looked around to see where the
second door was  The painter saw him do so and said Its behind you
I had to hide it behind the bed  Only then was K able to see the
little door in the wall  Its really much too small for a studio
here said the painter as if he wanted to anticipate an objection K
would make  I had to arrange things as well as I could  Thats
obviously a very bad place for the bed in front of the door  For
instance when the judge Im painting at present comes he always comes
through the door by the bed and Ive even given him a key to this door
so that he can wait for me here in the studio when Im not home
Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when Im still
asleep  And of course it always wakes me up when I hear the door
opened beside the bed however fast asleep I am  If you could hear the
way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning youd lose all
respect for judges  I suppose I could take the key away from him but
thatd only make things worse  It only takes a tiny effort to break any
of the doors here off their hinges  All the time the painter was
speaking K was considering whether he should take off his coat but he
finally realised that if he didnt do so he would be quite unable to
stay here any longer so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his
knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation
was over  He had hardly done this when one of the girls called out
Now hes taken his coat off and they could all be heard pressing
around the gaps in the planks to see the spectacle for themselves  The
girls think Im going to paint your portrait said the painter and
thats why youre taking your coat off  I see said K only
slightly amused by this as he felt little better than he had before
even though he now sat in his shirtsleeves  With some irritation he
asked What did you say the two other possibilities were?  He had
already forgotten the terms used  Apparent acquittal and deferment
said the painter  Its up to you which one you choose  You can get
either of them if I help you but itll take some effort of course the
difference between them is that apparent acquittal needs concentrated
effort for a while and that deferment takes much less effort but it has
to be sustained  Now then apparent acquittal  If thats what you want
Ill write down an assertion of your innocence on a piece of paper  The
text for an assertion of this sort was passed down to me from my father
and its quite unassailable  I take this assertion round to the judges
I know  So Ill start off with the one Im currently painting and put
the assertion to him when he comes for his sitting this evening  Ill
lay the assertion in front of him explain that youre innocent and give
him my personal guarantee of it  And thats not just a superficial
guarantee its a real one and its binding  The painters eyes seemed
to show some reproach of K for wanting to impose that sort of
responsibility on him  That would be very kind of you said K  And
would the judge then believe you and nonetheless not pass an absolute
acquittal?  Its like I just said answered the painter  And
anyway its not entirely sure that all the judges would believe me
many of them for instance might want me to bring you to see them
personally  So then youd have to come along too  But at least then
if that happens the matter is half way won especially as Id teach you
in advance exactly how youd need to act with the judge concerned of
course  What also happens though is that there are some judges wholl
turn me down in advance and thats worse  Ill certainly make several
attempts but still well have to forget about them but at least we
can afford to do that as no one judge can pass the decisive verdict
Then when Ive got enough judges signatures on this document I take it
to the judge whos concerned with your case  I might even have his
signature already in which case things develop a bit quicker than they
would do otherwise  But there arent usually many hold ups from then
on and thats the time that the defendant can feel most confident
Its odd but true that people feel more confidence in this time than
they do after theyve been acquitted  Theres no particular exertion
needed now  When he has the document asserting the defendants
innocence guaranteed by a number of other judges the judge can acquit
you without any worries and although there are still several
formalities to be gone through theres no doubt that thats what hell
do as a favour to me and several other acquaintances  You however
walk out the court and youre free  So then Ill be free said K
hesitantly  Thats right said the painter but only apparently free
or to put it a better way temporarily free as the most junior judges
the ones I know they dont have the right to give the final acquittal
Only the highest judge can do that in the court thats quite out of reach
for you for me and for all of us  We dont know how things look there
and incidentally we dont want to know   The right to acquit people
is a major privilege and our judges dont have it but they do have the
right to free people from the indictment  Thats to say if theyre
freed in this way then for the time being the charge is withdrawn but
its still hanging over their heads and it only takes an order from
higher up to bring it back into force  And as Im in such good contact
with the court I can also tell you how the difference between absolute
and apparent acquittal is described just in a superficial way in the
directives to the court offices  If theres an absolute acquittal all
proceedings should stop everything disappears from the process not
just the indictment but the trial and even the acquittal disappears
everything just disappears  With an apparent acquittal its different
When that happens nothing has changed except that the case for your
innocence for your acquittal and the grounds for the acquittal have
been made stronger  Apart from that proceedings go on as before the
court offices continue their business and the case gets passed to higher
courts gets passed back down to the lower courts and so on backwards
and forwards sometimes faster sometimes slower to and fro  Its
impossible to know exactly whats happening while this is going on
Seen from outside it can sometimes seem that everything has been long
since forgotten the documents have been lost and the acquittal is
complete  Noone familiar with the court would believe it  No
documents ever get lost the court forgets nothing   One day  noone
expects it  some judge or other picks up the documents and looks more
closely at them he notices that this particular case is still active
and orders the defendants immediate arrest  Ive been talking here as
if theres a long delay between apparent acquittal and rearrest that
is quite possible and I do know of cases like that but its just as
likely that the defendant goes home after hes been acquitted and finds
somebody there waiting to rearrest him  Then of course his life as a
free man is at an end  And does the trial start over again? preguntó
K finding it hard to believe  The trial will always start over
again said the painter but there is once again as before the
possibility of getting an apparent acquittal  Once again the accused
has to muster all his strength and mustnt give up  The painter said
that last phrase possibly as a result of the impression that K whose
shoulders had dropped somewhat gave on him  But to get a second
acquittal asked K as if in anticipation of further revelations by
the painter is that not harder to get than the first time?  As far
as thats concerned answered the painter theres nothing you can say
for certain  You mean do you that the second arrest would have an
adverse influence on the judge and the verdict he passes on the
defendant?  Thats not how it happens  When the acquittal is passed the
judges are already aware that rearrest is likely  So when it happens
it has hardly any effect  But there are countless other reasons why the
judges mood and their legal acumen in the case can be altered and
efforts to obtain the second acquittal must therefore be suited to the
new conditions and generally just as vigorous as the first  But this
second acquittal will once again not be final said K shaking his
head  Of course not said the painter the second acquittal is
followed by the third arrest the third acquittal by the fourth arrest
and so on  Thats what is meant by the term apparent acquittal  K
was silent  You clearly dont think an apparent acquittal offers much
advantage said the painter perhaps deferment would suit you better
Would you like me to explain what deferment is about?  K nodded  The
painter had leant back and spread himself out in his chair his
nightshirt was wide open he had pushed his hand inside and was stroking
his breast and his sides  Deferment said the painter looking
vaguely in front of himself for a while as if trying to find a perfectly
appropriate explanation deferment consists of keeping proceedings
permanently in their earliest stages  To do that the accused and those
helping him need to keep in continuous personal contact with the court
especially those helping him  I repeat this doesnt require so much
effort as getting an apparent acquittal but it probably requires a lot
more attention  You must never let the trial out of your sight you
have to go and see the appropriate judge at regular intervals as well as
when something in particular comes up and whatever you do you have to
try and remain friendly with him; if you dont know the judge personally
you have to influence him through the judges you do know and you have
to do it without giving up on the direct discussions  As long as you
dont fail to do any of these things you can be reasonably sure the
trial wont get past its first stages  The trial doesnt stop but the
defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if hed been
acquitted  Compared with an apparent acquittal deferment has the
advantage that the defendants future is less uncertain hes safe from
the shock of being suddenly rearrested and doesnt need to fear the
exertions and stress involved in getting an apparent acquittal just when
everything else in his life would make it most difficult  Deferment
does have certain disadvantages of its own though too and they
shouldnt be underestimated  I dont mean by this that the defendant
is never free hes never free in the proper sense of the word with an
apparent acquittal either  Theres another disadvantage  Proceedings
cant be prevented from moving forward unless there are some at least
ostensible reasons given  So something needs to seem to be happening
when looked at from the outside  This means that from time to time
various injunctions have to be obeyed the accused has to be questioned
investigations have to take place and so on  The trials been
artificially constrained inside a tiny circle and it has to be
continuously spun round within it  And that of course brings with it
certain unpleasantnesses for the accused although you shouldnt imagine
theyre all that bad  All of this is just for show the interrogations
for instance theyre only very short if you ever dont have the time
or dont feel like going to them you can offer an excuse with some
judges you can even arrange the injunctions together a long time in
advance in essence all it means is that as the accused you have to
report to the judge from time to time  Even while the painter was
speaking those last words K had laid his coat over his arm and had
stood up  Immediately from outside the door there was a cry of  Hes
standing up now  Are you leaving already? asked the painter who
had also stood up  It must be the air thats driving you out  Im
very sorry about that  Theres still a lot I need to tell you  I had
to put everything very briefly but I hope at least it was all clear
Oh yes said K whose head was aching from the effort of listening
Despite this affirmation the painter summed it all up once more as if
he wanted to give K something to console him on his way home  Both
have in common that they prevent the defendant being convicted he
said  But they also prevent his being properly acquitted said K
quietly as if ashamed to acknowledge it Youve got it in essence
said the painter quickly  K placed his hand on his winter overcoat but
could not bring himself to put it on  Most of all he would have liked
to pack everything together and run out to the fresh air  Not even the
girls could induce him to put his coat on even though they were already
loudly telling each other that he was doing so  The painter still had
to interpret Ks mood in some way so he said I expect youve
deliberately avoided deciding between my suggestions yet  Thats good
I would even have advised against making a decision straight away
Theres no more than a hairs breadth of difference between the
advantages and disadvantages  Everything has to be carefully weighed
up  But the most important thing is you shouldnt lose too much time
Ill come back here again soon said K who had suddenly decided to
put his frock coat on threw his overcoat over his shoulder and hurried
over to the door behind which the girls now began to scream  K thought
he could even see the screaming girls through the door  Well youll
have to keep your word said the painter who had not followed him
otherwise Ill come to the bank to ask about it myself  Will you open
this door for me said K pulling at the handle which as he noticed
from the resistance was being held tightly by the girls on the other
side  Do you want to be bothered by the girls? asked the painter
Its better if you use the other way out he said pointing to the
door behind the bed  K agreed to this and jumped back to the bed  But
instead of opening that door the painter crawled under the bed and from
underneath it asked K Just a moment more would you not like to see a
picture I could sell to you?  K did not want to be impolite the
painter really had taken his side and promised to help him more in the
future and because of Ks forgetfulness there had been no mention of
any payment for the painters help so K could not turn him down now
and allowed him to show him the picture even though he was quivering
with impatience to get out of the studio  From under the bed the
painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings  They were so covered in
dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust
swirled around in front of Ks eyes robbing him of breath for some
time  Moorland landscape said the painter passing the picture to K
It showed two sickly trees well separated from each other in dark
grass  In the background there was a multicoloured sunset  Thats
nice said K  Ill buy it  K expressed himself in this curt way
without any thought so he was glad when the painter did not take this
amiss and picked up a second painting from the floor  This is a
counterpart to the first picture said the painter  Perhaps it had
been intended as a counterpart but there was not the slightest
difference to be seen between it and the first picture there were the
trees there the grass and there the sunset  But this was of little
importance to K  They are beautiful landscapes he said Ill buy
them both and hang them in my office  You seem to like this subject
said the painter picking up a third painting good job Ive still got
another similar picture here  The picture though was not similar
rather it was exactly the same moorland landscape  The painter was
fully exploiting this opportunity to sell off his old pictures  Ill
take this one too said K  How much do the three paintings cost?
We can talk about that next time said the painter  Youre in a
hurry now and well still be in contact  And besides Im glad you
like the paintings Ill give you all the paintings Ive got down here
Theyre all moorland landscapes Ive painted a lot of moorland
landscapes  A lot of people dont like that sort of picture because
theyre too gloomy but there are others and youre one of them who
love gloomy themes  But K was not in the mood to hear about the
professional experiences of this painter cum beggar  Wrap them all
up he called out interrupting the painter as he was speaking my
servant will come to fetch them in the morning  Theres no need for
that said the painter  I expect I can find a porter for you who can
go with you now  And at last he leant over the bed and unlocked the
door  Just step on the bed dont worry about that said the painter
thats what everyone does who comes in here  Even without this
invitation K had shown no compunction in already placing his foot in
the middle of the bed covers then he looked out through the open door
and drew his foot back again  What is that? he asked the painter
What are you so surprised at? he asked surprised in his turn  Those
are court offices  Didnt you know there are court offices here? Ahí
are court offices in almost every attic why should this building be any
different?  Even my studio is actually one of the court offices but the
court put it at my disposal  It was not so much finding court offices
even here that shocked K he was mainly shocked at himself at his own
naïvety in court matters  It seemed to him that one of the most basic
rules governing how a defendant should behave was always to be prepared
never allow surprises never to look unsuspecting to the right when
the judge stood beside him to his left  and this was the very basic
rule that he was continually violating  A long corridor extended in
front of him air blew in from it which compared with the air in the
studio was refreshing  There were benches set along each side of the
corridor just as in the waiting area for the office he went to himself
There seemed to be precise rules governing how offices should be
equipped   There did not seem to be many people visiting the offices
that day  There was a man there half sitting half laying his face
was buried in his arm on the bench and he seemed to be sleeping; otro
man was standing in the halfdark at the end of the corridor  K now
climbed over the bed the painter followed him with the pictures  They
soon came across a servant of the court  K was now able to recognise
all the servants of the court from the gold buttons they wore on their
civilian clothes below the normal buttons  and the painter instructed
him to go with K carrying the pictures  K staggered more than he
walked his handkerchief pressed over his mouth  They had nearly
reached the exit when the girls stormed in on them so K had not been
able to avoid them  They had clearly seen that the second door of the
studio had been opened and had gone around to impose themselves on him
from this side  I cant come with you any further called out the
painter with a laugh as the girls pressed in  Goodbye and dont
hesitate too long  K did not even look round at him  Once on the
street he took the first cab he came across  He now had to get rid of
the servant whose gold button continually caught his eye even if it
caught noone elses  As a servant the servant of the court was going
to sit on the coachbox  But K chased him down from there  It was
already well into the afternoon when K arrived in front of the bank
He would have liked to leave the pictures in the cab but feared there
might be some occasion when he would have to let the painter see he
still had them  So he had the pictures taken to his office and locked
them in the lowest drawer of his desk so that he could at least keep
them safe from the deputy directors view for the next few days
Chapter Eight
 Block the businessman   Dismissing the lawyer
        K had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the
lawyer   It was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was
the right decision but this was outweighed by his belief in its
necessity  This decision on the day he intended to go to see the
lawyer took a lot of the strength he needed for his work he worked
exceptionally slowly he had to remain in his office a long time and it
was already past ten oclock when he finally stood in front of the
lawyers front door  Even before he rang he considered whether it might
not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone a
personal conversation would certainly be very difficult  Nonetheless
K did not actually want to do without it if he gave notice by any
other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated
words and unless Leni could discover anything K would never learn how
the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be
in the lawyers not unimportant opinion  But sitting in front of him
and taken by surprise by his dismissal K would be able easily to infer
everything he wanted from the lawyers face and behaviour even if he
could not be induced to say very much  It was not even out of the
question that K might after all be persuaded that it would be best to
leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal
        As usual there was at first no response to Ks ring at the door
Leni could be a bit quicker thought K  But he could at least be glad
there was nobody else interfering as usually happened be it the man in
his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him  As K pressed on
the button for the second time he looked back at the other door but
this time it too remained closed  At last two eyes appeared at the
spyhatch in the lawyers door although they werent Lenis eyes
Someone unlocked the door but kept himself pressed against it as he
called back inside Its him and only then did he open the door
properly  K pushed against the door as behind him he could already
hear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the other
flat  When the door in front of him finally opened he stormed straight
into the hallway  Through the corridor which led between the rooms he
saw Leni to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been directed
still running away in her nightshirt  He looked at her for a moment
and then looked round at the person who had opened the door  It was a
small wizened man with a full beard he held a candle in his hand  Do
you work here? asked K  No answered the man I dont belong here
at all the lawyer is only representing me Im here on legal business
Without your coat? asked K indicating the mans deficiency of dress
with a gesture of his hand  Oh do forgive me said the man and he
looked at himself in the light of the candle he was holding as if he had
not known about his appearance until then
Is Leni your lover? asked K curtly  He had set his legs slightly
apart his hands in which he held his hat were behind his back
Merely by being in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage
over this thin little man  Oh God he said and shocked raised one
hand in front of his face as if in defence no no what can you be
thinking?  You look honest enough said K with a smile but come
along anyway  K indicated with his hat which way the man was to go
and let him go ahead of him  What is your name then? asked K on the
way  Block  Im a businessman said the small man twisting himself
round as he thus introduced himself although K did not allow him to
stop moving  Is that your real name? asked K  Of course it is was
the mans reply why do you doubt it?  I thought you might have some
reason to keep your name secret said K  He felt himself as much at
liberty as is normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with
people of lower standing keeping everything about himself to himself
speaking only casually about the interests of the other able to raise
him to a level above ones own but also able at will to let him drop
again  K stopped at the door of the lawyers office opened it and to
the businessman who had obediently gone ahead called Not so fast
Bring some light here  K thought Leni might have hidden in here he
let the businessman search in every corner but the room was empty  In
front of the picture of the judge K took hold of the businessmans
braces to stop him moving on  Do you know him? he asked pointing
upwards with his finger  The businessman lifted the candle blinked as
he looked up and said Its a judge  An important judge? asked K
and stood to the side and in front of the businessman so that he could
observe what impression the picture had on him  The businessman was
looking up in admiration  Hes an important judge  You dont have
much insight said K  He is the lowest of the lowest examining
judges  I remember now said the businessman as he lowered the
candle thats what Ive already been told  Well of course you
have called out K Id forgotten about it of course you would
already have been told  But why why? asked the businessman as he
moved forwards towards the door propelled by the hands of K  Outside
in the corridor K said
You know where Lenis hidden do you?  Hidden? said the businessman
No but she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer  Why
didnt you say that immediately? asked K  I was going to take you
there but you called me back again answered the businessman as if
confused by the contradictory commands  You think youre very clever
dont you said K now take me there  K had never been in the
kitchen it was surprisingly big and very well equipped  The stove
alone was three times bigger than normal stoves but it was not possible
to see any detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated
by no more than a small lamp hanging by the entrance  At the stove
stood Leni in a white apron as always breaking eggs into a pot
standing on a spirit lamp
Good evening Josef she said with a glance sideways  Good evening
said K pointing with one hand to a chair in a corner which the
businessman was to sit on and he did indeed sit down on it  K however
went very close behind Lenis back leant over her shoulder and asked
Who is this man?  Leni put one hand around K as she stirred the soup
with the other she drew him forward toward herself and said Hes a
pitiful character a poor businessman by the name of Block  Just look
at him  The two of them looked back over their shoulders  The
businessman was sitting on the chair that K had directed him to he had
extinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed on
the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke  You were in your
nightshirt said K putting his hand on her head and turning it back
towards the stove  She was silent  Is he your lover? asked K  She
was about to take hold of the pot of soup but K took both her hands
and said Answer me  She said Come into the office Ill explain
everything to you  No said K I want you to explain it here
She put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him  K though pushed
her away and said I dont want you to kiss me now  Josef said
Leni looking at K imploringly but frankly in the eyes youre not
going to be jealous of Mr Block now are you?  Rudi she then said
turning to the businessman help me out will you Im being suspected
of something you can see that leave the candle alone  It had looked
as though Mr Block had not been paying attention but he had been
following closely  I dont even know why you might be jealous he
said ingenuously  Nor do I actually said K looking at the
businessman with a smile  Leni laughed out loud and while K was not
paying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering
Leave him alone now you can see what sort of person he is  Ive been
helping him a little bit because hes an important client of the
lawyers and no other reason  And what about you?  Do you want to
speak to the lawyer at this time of day?  Hes very unwell today but if
you want Ill tell him youre here  But you can certainly spend the
night with me  Its so long since you were last here even the lawyer
has been asking about you  Dont neglect your case  And Ive got some
things to tell you that Ive learned about  But now before anything
else take your coat off  She helped him off with his coat took the
hat off his head ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up
then she ran back and saw to the soup  Do you want me to tell him
youre here straight away or take him his soup first?  Tell him Im
here first said K  He was in a bad mood he had originally intended a
detailed discussion of his business with Leni especially the question
of his giving the lawyer notice but now he no longer wanted to because
of the presence of the businessman  Now he considered his affair too
important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps
change some of his decisions and so
he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the
lawyer  Bring him his soup first he said I want him to get his
strength up for the discussion with me hell need it  Youre a
client of the lawyers too arent you said the businessman quietly
from his corner as if he were trying to find this out  It was not
however taken well  What business is that of yours? said K and
Leni said
Will you be quiet  Ill take him his soup first then shall I? Y
she poured the soup into a dish The only worry then is that he might
go to sleep soon after hes eaten  What Ive got to say to him will
keep him awake said K who still wanted to intimate that he intended
some important negotiations with the lawyer he wanted Leni to ask him
what it was and only then to ask her advice  But instead she just
promptly carried out the order he had given her  When she went over to
him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and whispered
Ill tell him youre here as soon as hes eaten the soup so that I can
get you back as soon as possible  Just go said K just go  Be
a bit more friendly she said and still holding the dish turned
completely round once more in the doorway
        K watched her as she went; the decision had finally been made
that the lawyer was to be dismissed it was probably better that he had
not been able to discuss the matter any more with Leni beforehand; ella
hardly understood the complexity of the matter she would certainly have
advised him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from
dismissing the lawyer this time he would have remained in doubt and
unease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while anyway
as this decision was something he could not avoid  The sooner it was
carried out the more harm would be avoided  And moreover perhaps the
businessman had something to say on the matter
        K turned round the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about
to stand up  Stay where you are said K and pulled up a chair beside
him  Have you been a client of the lawyers for a long time? asked K
Yes said the businessman a very long time  How many years has he
been representing you so far then? asked K  I dont know how you
mean said the businessman hes been my business lawyer  I buy and
sell cereals  hes been my business lawyer since I took the business
over and thats about twenty years now but perhaps you mean my own
trial and hes been representing me in that since it started and thats
been more than five years  Yes well over five years he then added
pulling out an old briefcase Ive got everything written down; puedo
tell you the exact dates if you like  Its so hard to remember
everything  Probably my trials been going on much longer than that
it started soon after the death of my wife and thats been more than
five and a half years now  K moved in closer to him  So the lawyer
takes on ordinary legal business does he? he asked  This combination
of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for
K  Oh yes said the businessman and then he whispered  They even
say hes more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters
But then he seemed to regret saying this and he laid a hand on Ks
shoulder and said Please dont betray me to him will you  K patted
his thigh to reassure him and said No I dont betray people  He
can be so vindictive you see said the businessman
Im sure he wont do anything against such a faithful client as you
said K  Oh he might do said the businessman when he gets cross it
doesnt matter who it is and anyway Im not really faithful to him
Hows that then? asked K  Im not sure I should tell you about it
said the businessman hesitantly  I think itll be alright said K
Well then said the businessman Ill tell you about some of it but
youll have to tell me a secret too then we can support each other with
the lawyer  You are very careful said K but Ill tell you a
secret that will set your mind completely at ease  Now tell me in what
way have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?  Ive  said the
businessman hesitantly and in a tone as if he were confessing something
dishonourable Ive taken on other lawyers besides him  Thats not
so serious said K a little disappointed  It is here said the
businessman who had had some difficulty breathing since making his
confession but who now after hearing Ks comment began to feel more
trust for him  Thats not allowed  And its allowed least of all to
take on petty lawyers when youve already got a proper one  And thats
just what I have done besides him Ive got five petty lawyers
Five exclaimed K astonished at this number Five lawyers besides
this one?  The businessman nodded  Im even negotiating with a sixth
one  But why do you need so many lawyers? asked K  I need all of
them said the businessman  Would you mind explaining that to me?
asked K  Id be glad to said the businessman  Most of all I dont
want to lose my case well thats obvious  So that means I mustnt
neglect anything that might be of use to me; even if theres very little
hope of a particular thing being of any use I cant just throw it away
So everything I have Ive put to use in my case  Ive taken all the
money out of my business for example the offices for my business used
to occupy nearly a whole floor but now all I need is a little room at
the back where I work with one apprentice  It wasnt just using up the
money that caused the difficulty of course it was much more to do with
me not working at the business as much as I used to  If you want to do
something about your trial you dont have much time for anything else
So youre also working at the court yourself? asked K  Thats just
what I want to learn more about  I cant tell you very much about
that said the businessman at first I tried to do that too but I soon
had to give it up again  It wears you out too much and its really not
much use  And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there
yourself and to negotiate at least for me it was  Its a heavy strain
there just sitting and waiting  You know yourself what the air is like
in those offices  How do you know Ive been there then? asked K
I was in the waiting room myself when you went through  What a
coincidence that is exclaimed K totally engrossed and forgetting how
ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier  So you saw me
You were in the waiting room when I went through  Yes I did go through
it one time  It isnt such a big coincidence said the businessman
Im there nearly every day  I expect Ill have to go there quite
often myself now said K although I can hardly expect to be shown
the same respect as I was then  They all stood up for me  They must
have thought I was a judge  No said the businessman we were
greeting the servant of the court  We knew you were a defendant  That
sort of news spreads very quickly  So you already knew about that
said K the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you  Did
you criticise me for it afterwards?  No said the businessman quite
the opposite  That was just stupidity  What do you mean
stupidity? asked K  Why are you asking about it? dijo el
businessman in some irritation  You still dont seem to know the
people there and you might take it wrong  Dont forget in proceedings
like this there are always lots of different things coming up to talk
about things that you just cant understand with reason alone you just
get too tired and distracted for most things and so instead people
rely on superstition  Im talking about the others but Im no better
myself  One of these superstitions for example is that you can learn
a lot about the outcome of a defendants case by looking at his face
especially the shape of his lips  There are lots who believe that and
they said they could see from the shape of your lips that youd
definitely be found guilty very soon  I repeat that all this is just a
ridiculous superstition and in most cases its completely disproved by
the facts but when you live in that society its hard to hold yourself
back from beliefs like that  Just think how much effect that
superstition can have  You spoke to one of them there didnt you?  He
was hardly able to give you an answer  There are lots of things there
that can make you confused of course but one of them for him was the
appearance of your lips  He told us all later he thought he could see
something in your lips that meant hed be convicted himself  On my
lips? asked K pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself  I
can see nothing special about my lips  Can you?  Nor can I said the
businessman nothing at all  These people are so superstitious
exclaimed K  Isnt that what I just told you? asked the businessman
Do you then have that much contact with each other exchanging each
others opinions? said K  Ive kept myself completely apart so far
They dont normally have much contact with each other said the
businessman that would be impossible there are so many of them  And
they dont have much in common either  If a group of them ever thinks
they have found something in common it soon turns out they were
mistaken  Theres nothing you can do as a group where the courts
concerned  Each case is examined separately the court is very
painstaking  So theres nothing to be achieved by forming into a group
only sometimes an individual will achieve something in secret; y es
only when thats been done the others learn about it; nobody knows how
it was done  So theres no sense of togetherness you meet people now
and then in the waiting rooms but we dont talk much there  The
superstitious beliefs were established a long time ago and they spread
all by themselves  I saw those gentlemen in the waiting room said
K it seemed so pointless for them to be waiting in that way
Waiting is not pointless said the businessman its only pointless
if you try and interfere yourself  I told you just now Ive got five
lawyers besides this one  You might think  I thought it myself at
first  you might think I could leave the whole thing entirely up to
them now  That would be entirely wrong  I can leave it up to them less
than when I had just the one  Maybe you dont understand that do you?
No said K and to slow the businessman down who had been speaking
too fast he laid his hand on the businessmans to reassure him but
Id like just to ask you to speak a little more slowly these are many
very important things for me and I cant follow exactly what youre
saying  Youre quite right to remind me of that said the
businessman youre new to all this a junior  Your trial is six
months old isnt it?  Yes Ive heard about it  Such a new case  But
Ive already thought all these things through countless times to me
theyre the most obvious things in the world  You must be glad your
trial has already progressed so far are you? asked K he did not wish
to ask directly how the businessmans affairs stood but received no
clear answer anyway  Yes Ive been working at my trial for five years
now said the businessman as his head sank thats no small
achievement  Then he was silent for a while  K listened to hear
whether Leni was on her way back  On the one hand he did not want her
to come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not
want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman
but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the
lawyer when K was there much longer than she needed to give him his
soup  I still remember it exactly the businessman began again and
K immediately gave him his full attention when my case was as old as
yours is now  I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasnt very
satisfied with him  Now Ill find out everything thought K nodding
vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say
everything worth knowing  My case the businessman continued didnt
move on at all there were some hearings that took place and I went to
every one of them collected materials handed all my business books to
the court  which I later found was entirely  unnecessary  I ran back
and forth to the lawyer and he submitted various documents to the court
too   Various documents? asked K  Yes thats right said the
businessman  Thats very important for me said K in my case hes
still working on the first set of documents  He still hasnt done
anything  I see now that hes been neglecting me quite disgracefully
There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still arent
ready said the businessman and anyway it turned out later on that
the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless  I even read one
of them myself one of the officials at the court was very helpful  It
was very learned but it didnt actually say anything  Most of all
there was lots of Latin which I cant understand then pages and pages
of general appeals to the court then lots of flattery for particular
officials they werent named these officials but anyone familiar with
the court must have been able to guess who they were then there was
selfpraise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a
way that was downright doglike and then endless investigations of
cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine
Although as far as I was able to follow them these investigations had
been carried out very carefully  Now I dont mean to criticise the
lawyers work with all of this and the document I read was only one of
many but even so and this is something I will say at that time I
couldnt see any progress in my trial at all  And what sort of
progress had you been hoping for? asked K  Thats a very sensible
question said the businessman with a smile its only very rare that
you see any progress in these proceedings at all  But I didnt know
that then  Im a businessman much more in those days than now I
wanted to see some tangible progress it should have all been moving to
some conclusion or at least should have been moving on in some way
according to the rules  Instead of which there were just more hearings
and most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the
answers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the
court coming to me at work several times a week or they came to me at
home or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing
of course (but at least now things are better in that respect its much
less disturbing when they contact you by telephone) and rumours about
my trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business
with and especially my relations so I was being made to suffer in many
different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the
first hearing would take place soon  So I went to the lawyer and
complained about it  He explained it all to me at length but refused
to do anything I asked for noone has any influence on the way the
trial proceeds he said to try and insist on it in any of the documents
submitted  like I was asking  was simply unheard of and would do harm
to both him and me  I thought to myself: What this lawyer cant or
wont do another lawyer will  So I looked round for other lawyers  And
before you say anything: none of them asked for a definite date for the
main trial and none of them got one and anyway apart from one
exception which Ill talk about in a minute it really is impossible
thats one thing this lawyer didnt mislead me about; but besides I had
no reason to regret turning to other lawyers  Perhaps youve already
heard how Dr Huld talks about the petty lawyers he probably made them
sound very contemptible to you and hes right they are contemptible
But when he talks about them and compares them with himself and his
colleagues theres a small error running through what he says and just
for your interest Ill tell you about it  When he talks about the
lawyers he mixes with he sets them apart by calling them the great
lawyers  Thats wrong anyone can call himself great if he wants to
of course but in this case only the usage of the court can make that
distinction  You see the court says that besides the petty lawyers
there are also minor lawyers and great lawyers  This one and his
colleagues are only minor lawyers and the difference in rank between
them and the great lawyers who Ive only ever heard about and never
seen is incomparably greater than between the minor lawyers and the
despised petty lawyers  The great lawyers? asked K  Who are they
then?  How do you contact them?  Youve never heard about them then?
said the businessman  Theres hardly anyone whos been accused who
doesnt spend a lot of time dreaming about the great lawyers once hes
heard about them  Its best if you dont let yourself be misled in that
way  I dont know who the great lawyers are and theres probably no
way of contacting them  I dont know of any case I can talk about with
certainty where theyve taken any part  They do defend a lot of people
but you cant get hold of them by your own efforts they only defend
those who they want to defend  And I dont suppose they ever take on
cases that havent already got past the lower courts  Anyway its best
not to think about them as if you do it makes the discussions with the
other lawyers all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve
seem so unpleasant and useless I had that experience myself just
wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing
more about it  But that of course would be the stupidest thing you
could do and you wouldnt be left in peace in bed for very long
either  So you werent thinking about the great lawyers at that
time? asked K  Not for very long said the businessman and smiled
again you cant forget about them entirely Im afraid especially in
the night when these thoughts come so easily  But I wanted immediate
results in those days so I went to the petty lawyers
        Well look at you two sat huddled together called Leni as she
came back with the dish and stood in the doorway  They were indeed sat
close together if either of them turned his head even slightly it would
have knocked against the others the businessman was not only very
small but also sat hunched down so that K was also forced to bend down
low if he wanted to hear everything  Not quite yet called out K to
turn Leni away his hand still resting on the businessmans hand
twitching with impatience  He wanted me to tell him about my trial
said the businessman to Leni  Carry on then carry on she said
She spoke to the businessman with affection but at the same time with
condescension  K did not like that he had begun to learn that the man
was of some value after all he had experience at least and he was
willing to share it  Leni was probably wrong about him  He watched her
in irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessmans hand 
which he had been holding on to all this time  wiped his hand with her
apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that had dripped
from the candle onto his trousers  You were about to tell me about the
petty lawyers said K shoving Lenis hand away with no further
comment  Whats wrong with you today? asked Leni tapped him gently
and carried on with what she had been doing  Yes the petty lawyers
said the businessman putting his hand to his brow as if thinking hard
K wanted to help him and said You wanted immediate results and so
went to the petty lawyers
Yes thats right said the businessman but did not continue with
what hed been saying  Maybe he doesnt want to speak about it in
front of Leni thought K suppressing his impatience to hear the rest
straight away and stopped trying to press him
        Have you told him Im here? he asked Leni  Course I have she
said hes waiting for you  Leave Block alone now you can talk to
Block later hell still be here  K still hesitated  Youll still
be here? he asked the businessman wanting to hear the answer from him
and not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he werent
there he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today  And once
more it was only Leni who answered  He often sleeps here  He sleeps
here? exclaimed K he had thought the businessman would just wait
there for him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer and
then they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and
undisturbed  Yes said Leni not everyones like you Josef allowed
to see the lawyer at any time you like  Dont even seem surprised
that the lawyer despite being ill still receives you at eleven oclock
at night  You take it far too much for granted what your friends do
for you  Well your friends or at least I do we like to do things for
you  I dont want or need any more thanks than that youre fond of me
Fond of you? thought K at first and only then it occurred to him
Well yes I am fond of her Nonetheless what he said forgetting all
the rest was He receives me because I am his client  If I needed
anyone elses help Id have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do
anything  Hes really nasty today isnt he? Leni asked the
businessman  Now its me whos not here thought K and nearly lost
his temper with the businessman when with the same rudeness as Leni he
said The lawyer also has other reasons to receive him  His case is
much more interesting than mine  And its only in its early stages too
it probably hasnt progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal
with him  Thatll all change later on  Yeah yeah said Leni
looking at the businessman and laughing He doesnt half talk she
said turning to face K  You cant believe a word he says  Hes as
talkative as he is sweet  Maybe thats why the lawyer cant stand him
At least he only sees him when hes in the right mood  Ive already
tried hard to change that but its impossible  Just think there are
times when I tell him Blocks here and he doesnt receive him until
three days later  And if Block isnt on the spot when hes called then
everythings lost and it all has to start all over again  Thats why I
let Block sleep here it wouldnt be the first time Dr Huld has wanted
to see him in the night  So now Block is ready for that   Sometimes
when he knows Block is still here hell even change his mind about
letting him in to see him  K looked questioningly at the businessman
The latter nodded and although he had spoken quite openly with K
earlier seemed to be confused with shame as he said Yes later on you
become very dependent on your lawyer  Hes only pretending to mind
said Leni  He likes to sleep here really hes often said so  She
went over to a little door and shoved it open  Do you want to see his
bedroom? she asked  K went over to the low windowless room and
looked in from the doorway  The room contained a narrow bed which
filled it completely so that to get into the bed you would need to
climb over the bedpost  At the head of the bed there was a niche in the
wall where fastidiously tidy stood a candle a bottle of ink and a
pen with a bundle of papers which were probably to do with the trial
You sleep in the maids room? asked K as he went back to the
businessman  Lenis let me have it answered the businessman it has
many advantages  K looked long at him; his first impression of the
businessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trial
had already lasted a long time but he had paid a heavy price for this
experience  K was suddenly unable to bear the sight of the businessman
any longer  Bring him to bed then he called out to Leni who seemed
to understand him  For himself he wanted to go to the lawyer and by
dismissing him free himself from not only the lawyer but also from Leni
and the businessman  But before he had reached the door the businessman
spoke to him gently  Excuse me sir he said and K looked round
crossly  Youve forgotten your promise said the businessman
stretching his hand out to K imploringly from where he sat  You were
going to tell me a secret  That is true said K as he glanced at
Leni who was watching him carefully to check on her  So listen; sus
hardly a secret now anyway  Im going to see the lawyer now to sack
him  Hes sacking him yelled the businessman and he jumped up from
his chair and ran around the kitchen with his arms in the air  He kept
on shouting Hes sacking his lawyer  Leni tried to rush at K but
the businessman got in her way so that she shoved him away with her
fists  Then still with her hands balled into fists she ran after K
who however had been given a long start  He was already inside the
lawyers room by the time Leni caught up with him  He had almost closed
the door behind himself but Leni held the door open with her foot
grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back  But he put such pressure on
her wrist that with a sigh she was forced to release him  She did not
dare go into the room straight away and K locked the door with the
llave
        Ive been waiting for you a very long time said the lawyer from
his bed  He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now
he laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on looking at K
sharply through them  Instead of apologising K said Ill be leaving
again soon  As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K said
and replied I wont let you in this late again next time  I find
that quite acceptable said K  The lawyer looked at him quizzically
Sit down he said  As you wish said K drawing a chair up to the
bedside table and sitting down
It seemed to me that you locked the door said the lawyer  Yes
said K it was because of Leni  He had no intention of letting
anyone off lightly  But the lawyer asked him Was she being
importunate again?  Importunate? asked K  Yes said the lawyer
laughing as he did so had a fit of coughing and then once it had
passed began to laugh again  Im sure you must have noticed how
importunate she can be sometimes he said and patted Ks hand which
K had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched back  You
dont attach much importance to it then said the lawyer when K was
silent so much the better  Otherwise I might have needed to apologise
to you  It is a peculiarity of Lenis  Ive long since forgiven her
for it and I wouldnt be talking of it now if you hadnt locked the
door just now  Anyway perhaps I should at least explain this
peculiarity of hers to you but you seem rather disturbed the way
youre looking at me and so thats why Ill do it this peculiarity of
hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive  She
attaches herself to each of them loves each of them even seems to be
loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me
about them when I allow her to  I am not so astonished by all of this
as you seem to be  If you look at them in the right way the accused
really can be attractive quite often  But that is a remarkable and to
some extent scientific phenomenon  Being indicted does not cause any
clear precisely definable change in a persons appearance of course
But its not like with other legal matters most of them remain in their
usual way of life and if they have a good lawyer looking after them
the trial doesnt get in their way  But there are nonetheless those who
have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd however big
and tell you which among them is facing a charge  How can they do that
you will ask  My answer will not please you  It is simply that those
who are facing a charge are the most attractive  It cannot be their
guilt that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty  at
least thats what I as a lawyer have to say  and nor can it be the
proper punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are
punished so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them
take some kind of hold on them  Whatever the reason some of these
attractive people are indeed very attractive  But all of them are
attractive even Block pitiful worm that he is  As the lawyer
finished what he was saying K was fully in control of himself he had
even nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to
himself the view he had already formed; that the lawyer was trying to
confuse him as he always did by making general and irrelevant
observations and thus distract him from the main question of what he
was actually doing for Ks trial  The lawyer must have noticed that K
was offering him more resistance than before as he became silent
giving  K the chance to speak himself and then as K also remained
silent he asked Did you have a particular reason for coming to see me
today?  Yes said K putting his hand up to slightly shade his eyes
from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer better I
wanted to tell you that Im withdrawing my representation from you with
immediate effect  Do I understand you rightly? asked the lawyer as
he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself with one hand on
the pillow  I think you do said K sitting stiffly upright as if
waiting in ambush  Well we can certainly discuss this plan of yours
said the lawyer after a pause  Its not a plan any more said K
That may be said the lawyer but we still mustnt rush anything
He used the word we as if he had no intention of letting K go free
and as if even if he could no longer represent him he could still at
least continue as his adviser  Nothing is being rushed said K
standing slowly up and going behind his chair everything has been well
thought out and probably even for too long  The decision is final
Then allow me to say a few words said the lawyer throwing the bed
cover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed  His naked white
haired legs shivered in the cold  He asked K to pass him a blanket
from the couch  K passed him the blanket and said You are running
the risk of catching cold for no reason  The circumstances are
important enough said the lawyer as he wrapped the bed cover around
the top half of his body and then the blanket around his legs  Your
uncle is my friend and in the course of time Ive become fond of you as
well  I admit that quite openly  Theres nothing in that for me to be
ashamed of  It  was very unwelcome for K to hear the old man speak in
this touching way as it forced him to explain himself more fully which
he would rather have avoided and he was aware that it also confused him
even though it could never make him reverse his decision  Thank you
for feeling so friendly toward me he said and I also realise how
deeply involved youve been in my case as deeply as possible for
yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me  Nonetheless
I have recently come to the conviction that it is not enough  I would
naturally never attempt considering that you are so much older and more
experienced than I am to convince you of my opinion; if I have ever
unintentionally done so then I beg your forgiveness but as you have
just said yourself the circumstances are important enough and it is my
belief that my trial needs to be approached with much more vigour than
has so far been the case  I see said the lawyer youve become
impatient  I am not impatient said K with some irritation and he
stopped paying so much attention to his choice of words  When I first
came here with my uncle you probably noticed I wasnt greatly concerned
about my case and if I wasnt reminded of it by force as it were I
would forget about it completely  But my uncle insisted I should allow
you to represent me and I did so as a favour to him  I could have
expected the case to be less of a burden than it had been as the point
of taking on a lawyer is that he should take on some of its weight  But
what actually happened was the opposite  Before the trial was never
such a worry for me as it has been since youve been representing me
When I was by myself I never did anything about my case I was hardly
aware of it but then once there was someone representing me
everything was set for something to happen I was always without cease
waiting for you to do something getting more and more tense but you
did nothing  I did get some information about the court from you that I
probably could not have got anywhere else but that cant be enough when
the trial supposedly in secret is getting closer and closer to me
K had pushed the chair away and stood erect his hands in the pockets
of his frock coat  After a certain point in the proceedings said the
lawyer quietly and calmly nothing new of any importance ever happens
So many litigants at the same stage in their trials have stood before
me just like you are now and spoken in the same way  Then these other
litigants said K have all been right just as I am  That does not
show that Im not  I wasnt trying to show that you were mistaken
said the lawyer but I wanted to add that I expected better judgement
from you than from the others especially as Ive given you more insight
into the workings of the court and my own activities than I normally do
And now Im forced to accept that despite everything you have too
little trust in me  You dont make it easy for me  How the lawyer was
humiliating himself to K  He was showing no regard for the dignity of
his position which on this point must have been at its most sensitive
And why did he do that?  He did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well
a rich man neither the loss of income nor the loss of a client could
have been of much importance to him in themselves  He was moreover
unwell and should have been thinking of passing work on to others  And
despite all that he held on tightly to K  Why?  Was it something
personal for his uncles sake or did he really see Ks case as one
that was exceptional and hoped to be able to distinguish himself with
it either for Ks sake or  and this possibility could never be
excluded  for his friends at the court?  It was not possible to learn
anything by looking at him even though K was scrutinizing him quite
brazenly  It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his
thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have  But he
clearly deemed Ks silence to be favourable for himself and he
continued You will have noticed the size of my office but that I
dont employ any staff to help me  That used to be quite different
there was a time when several young lawyers were working for me but now
I work alone  This is partly to do with changes in the way I do
business in that I concentrate nowadays more and more on matters such
as your own case and partly to do with the ever deeper understanding
that I acquire from these legal matters  I found that I could never let
anyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted to harm both the
client and the job I had taken on  But the decision to do all the work
myself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn almost everyone away
who asked me to represent them and could only accept those I was
especially interested in  well there are enough creatures who leap at
every crumb I throw down and theyre not so very far away  Most
importantly I became ill from overwork  But despite that I dont
regret my decision quite possibly I should have turned more cases away
than I did but it did turn out to be entirely necessary for me to
devote myself fully to the cases I did take on and the successful
results showed that it was worth it  I once read a description of the
difference between representing someone in ordinary legal matters and in
legal matters of this sort and the writer expressed it very well  This
is what he said: some lawyers lead their clients on a thread until
judgement is passed but there are others who immediately lift their
clients onto their shoulders and carry them all the way to the judgement
and beyond  Thats just how it is  But it was quite true when I said I
never regret all this work  But if as in your case they are so fully
misunderstood well then I come very close to regretting it  All this
talking did more to make K impatient than to persuade him  From the
way the lawyer was speaking K thought he could hear what he could
expect if he gave in the delays and excuses would begin again reports
of how the documents were progressing how the mood of the court
officials had improved as well as all the enormous difficulties  in
short all that he had heard so many times before would be brought out
again even more fully he would try to mislead K with hopes that were
never specified and to make him suffer with threats that were never
clear  He had to put a stop to that so he said What will you
undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?  The lawyer
quietly accepted even this insulting question and answered I should
continue with what Ive already been doing for you  Thats just what
I thought said K and now you dont need to say another word  I
will make one more attempt said the lawyer as if whatever had been
making K so annoyed was affecting him too  You see I have the
impression that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have
given you but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this
way you seem although you are the accused to have been treated too
well or to put it a better way handled with neglect with apparent
neglect  Even that has its reason; it is often better to be in chains
than to be free  But I would like to show you how other defendants are
treated perhaps you will succeed in learning something from it  What I
will do is I will call Block in unlock the door and sit down here
beside the bedside table  Be glad to said K and did as the lawyer
suggested; he was always ready to learn something new  But to make sure
of himself for any event he added but you do realise that you are no
longer to be my lawyer dont you?  Yes said the lawyer  But you
can still change your mind today if you want to  He lay back down in
the bed pulled the quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall
Then he rang
        Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so  She looked
hurriedly at K and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened;
she seemed to be reassured by the sight of K sitting calmly at the
lawyers bed  She smiled and nodded to K K looked blankly back at
her  Fetch Block said the lawyer  But instead of going to fetch
him Leni just went to the door and called out Block  To the lawyer
Then probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and
was paying no attention she slipped in behind Ks chair  From then
on she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or
albeit very tenderly and carefully she would run her hands through his
hair and over his cheeks  K eventually tried to stop her by taking
hold of one hand and after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of
it  Block came as soon as he was called but he remained standing in
the doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he should enter or not
He raised his eyebrows and lowered his head as if listening to find out
whether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated  K could have
encouraged to enter but he had decided to make a final break not only
with the lawyer but with everything in his home so he kept himself
motionless  Leni was also silent  Block noticed that at least noone
was chasing him away and on tiptoe he entered the room his face was
tense his hands were clenched behind his back  He left the door open
in case he needed to go back again  K did not even glance at him he
looked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not
be seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall  Then his voice
was heard: Block here? he asked  Block had already crept some way
into the room but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the
breast and then another in the back he seemed about to fall but
remained standing deeply bowed and said At your service sir
¿Qué deseas? asked the lawyer youve come at a bad time
Wasnt I summoned? asked Block more to himself than the lawyer  He
held his hands in front of himself as protection and would have been
ready to run away any moment  You were summoned said the lawyer
but you have still come at a bad time  Then after a pause he added
You always come at a bad time  When the lawyer started speaking Block
had stopped looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the
corners just listening as if the light from the speaker were brighter
than Block could bear to look at  But it was also difficult for him to
listen as the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly
and quietly  Would you like me to go away again sir? asked Block
Well youre here now said the lawyer Stay  It was as if the
lawyer had not done as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with
a stick as now Block really began to shake  I went to see said the
lawyer the third judge yesterday a friend of mine and slowly brought
the conversation round to the subject of you  Do you want to know what
he said?  Oh yes please said Block  The lawyer did not answer
immediately so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if
about to kneel down  But then K spoke to him:  What do you think
youre doing? he shouted  Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out
and so he took hold of her other hand  It was not love that made him
squeeze it and hold on to it so tightly she sighed frequently and tried
to disengage her hands from him  But Block was punished for Ks
outburst as the lawyer asked him Who is your lawyer? Usted está
sir said Block  And who besides me? the lawyer asked  Noone
besides you sir said Block  And let there be noone besides me
said the lawyer  Block fully understood what that meant he glowered at
K shaking his head violently  If these actions had been translated
into words they would have been coarse insults  K had been friendly
and willing to discuss his own case with someone like this  I wont
disturb you any more said K leaning back in his chair  You can
kneel down or creep on all fours whatever you like  I wont bother
with you any more  But Block still had some sense of pride at least
where K was concerned and he went towards him waving his fists
shouting as loudly as he dared while the lawyer was there  You
shouldnt speak to me like that thats not allowed  Why are you
insulting me?  Especially here in front of the lawyer where both of us
you and me were only tolerated because of his charity  Youre not a
better person than me youve been accused of something too youre
facing a charge too  If in spite of that youre still a gentleman
then Im just as much a gentleman as you are if not even more so  And
I want to be spoken to as a gentleman especially by you  If you think
being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I creep on all fours
as you put it makes you something better than me then theres an old
legal saying you ought to bear in mind: If youre under suspicion its
better to be moving than still as if youre still you can be in the pan
of the scales without knowing it and be weighed along with your sins
K said nothing  He merely looked in amazement at this distracted
being his eyes completely still  He had gone through such changes in
just the last few hours  Was it the trial that was throwing him from
side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who was friend and who
was foe?  Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately humiliating him
and had no other purpose today than to show off his power to K and
perhaps even thereby subjugate K?  But if Block was incapable of seeing
that or if he so feared the lawyer that no such insight would even be
of any use to him how was it that he was either so sly or so bold as to
lie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact that he had other
lawyers working on his behalf?  And how did he dare to attack K who
could betray his secret any time he liked?  But he dared even more than
this he went to the lawyers bed and began there to make complaints
about K  Dr Huld sir he said did you hear the way this man spoke
to me?  You can count the length of his trial in hours and he wants to
tell me what to do when Ive been involved in a legal case for five
years  He even insults me  He doesnt know anything but he insults
me when I as far as my weak ability allows when Ive made a close
study of how to behave with the court what we ought to do and what the
court practices are  Dont let anyone bother you said the lawyer
and do what seems to you to be right  I will said Block as if
speaking to himself to give himself courage and with a quick glance to
the side he kneeled down close beside the bed  Im kneeling now Dr
Huld sir he said  But the lawyer remained silent  With one hand
Block carefully stroked the bed cover  In the silence while he did so
Leni as she freed herself from Ks hands said Youre hurting me
Let go of me  Im going over to Block  She went over to him and sat
on the edge of the bed  Block was very pleased at this and with lively
but silent gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with
the lawyer  It was clear that he desperately needed to be told
something by the lawyer although perhaps only so that he could make use
of the information with his other lawyers  Leni probably knew very well
how the lawyer could be brought round pointed to his hand and pursed
her lips as if making a kiss  Block immediately performed the handkiss
and at further urging from Leni repeated it twice more  But the
lawyer continued to be silent  Then Leni leant over the lawyer as she
stretched out the attractive shape of her body could be seen and bent
over close to his face she stroked his long white hair  That now
forced him to give an answer  Im rather wary of telling him said
the lawyer and his head could be seen shaking slightly perhaps so that
he would feel the pressure of Lenis hand better  Block listened
closely with his head lowered as if by listening he were breaking an
order  What makes you so wary about it? asked Leni  K had the
feeling he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated
many times that would be repeated many times more and that for Block
alone it would never lose its freshness  What has his behaviour been
like today? asked the lawyer instead of an answer  Before Leni said
anything she looked down at Block and watched him a short while as he
raised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly
Finally she gave a serious nod turned back to the lawyer and said
Hes been quiet and industrious  This was an elderly businessman a
man whose beard was long and he was begging a young girl to speak on
his behalf  Even if there was some plan behind what he did there was
nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man  K
could not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance
would win him over  Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him
want to leave then this scene would have done so  It was almost
humiliating even for the onlooker  So these were the lawyers methods
which K fortunately had not been exposed to for long to let the client
forget about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of
reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means  He was no longer a
client he was the lawyers dog  If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl
under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it then
he would have done so with enthusiasm  K listened to all of this
testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of
closely observing everything spoken here inform a higher office about
it and write a report  And what has he been doing all day? preguntó el
lawyer  I kept him locked in the maids room all day said Leni so
that he wouldnt stop me doing my work  Thats where he usually stays
From time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see what he was
doing and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers
you gave him propped up on the window sill  That made a good
impression on me; as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives
hardly any light  It showed how obedient he is that he was even reading
in those conditions  Im pleased to hear it said the lawyer  But
did he understand what he was reading?  While this conversation was
going on Block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating
the answers he hoped Leni would give  Well I cant give you any
certain answer to that of course said Leni but I could see that he
was reading thoroughly  He spent all day reading the same page running
his finger along the lines  Whenever I looked in on him he sighed as if
this reading was a lot of work for him  I expect the papers you gave
him were very hard to understand  Yes said the lawyer they
certainly are that  And I really dont think he understood anything of
them  But they should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a
struggle it is and how much work it is for me to defend him  And who am
I doing all this hard work for?  Im doing it  its laughable even to
say it  Im doing it for Block  He ought to realise what that means
too  Did he study without a pause?  Almost without a pause answered
Leni  Just the once he asked me for a drink of water so I gave him a
glassful through the window  Then at eight oclock I let him out and
gave him something to eat  Block glanced sideways at K as if he were
being praised and had to impress K as well  He now seemed more
optimistic he moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees
This made his astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the
following words from the lawyer:  You speak well of him said the
lawyer but thats just what makes it difficult for me  You see the
judge did not speak well of him at all neither about Block nor about
his case  Didnt speak well of him? asked Leni  How is that
possible?  Block looked at her with such tension he seemed to think
that although the judges words had been spoken so long before she would
be able to change them in his favour  Not at all said the lawyer
In fact he became quite cross when I started to talk about Block to
him Dont talk to me about Block he said  He is my client said
I  Youre letting him abuse you he said  I dont think his case is
lost yet said I  Youre letting him abuse you he repeated  I
dont think so said I  Block works hard in his case and always knows
where it stands  He practically lives with me so that he always knows
whats happening  You dont always find such enthusiasm as that  Hes
not very pleasant personally I grant you his manners are terrible and
hes dirty but as far as the trials concerned hes quite immaculate
I said immaculate but I was deliberately exaggerating   Then he said
Block is sly thats all  Hes accumulated plenty of experience and
knows how to delay proceedings  But theres more that he doesnt know
than he does  What do you think hed say if he learned his trial still
hasnt begun if you told him they havent even rung the bell to
announce the start of proceedings?  Alright Block alright said the
lawyer as at these words Block had begun to raise himself on his
trembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some explanation  It
was the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words directly to
Block  He looked down with his tired eyes half blankly and half at
Block who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze  What
the judge said has no meaning for you said the lawyer  You neednt
be frightened at every word  If you do it again I wont tell you
anything else at all  Its impossible to start a sentence without you
looking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement  You should
be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client  And youre
destroying the trust he has for me  Just what is it you want?  Youre
still alive youre still under my protection  Theres no point in
worrying  Somewhere youve read that the final judgement can often come
without warning from anyone at any time  And in the right
circumstances thats basically true but its also true that I dislike
your anxiety and fear and see that you dont have the trust in me you
should have  Now what have I just said?  I repeated something said by
one of the judges  You know that there are so many various opinions
about the procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can
make any sense of them  This judge for instance sees proceedings as
starting at a different point from where I do  A difference of opinion
nothing more  At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it
that a sign is given by ringing a bell  This judge sees that as the
point at which proceedings begin  I cant set out all the opinions
opposed to that view here and you wouldnt understand it anyway
suffice it to say that there are many reasons to disagree with him
Embarrassed Block ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet his
anxiety about what the judge had said had let him forget his inferior
status towards the lawyer for a while he thought only about himself and
turned the judges words round to examine them from all sides  Block
said Leni as if reprimanding him and taking hold of the collar of his
coat pulled him up slightly higher  Leave the carpet alone and listen
to what the lawyer is saying
This chapter was left unfinished
Chapter Nine
In the Cathedral
        A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to
visit the city for the first time and K was given the task of showing
him some of its cultural sights  At any other time he would have seen
this job as an honour but now when he was finding it hard even to
maintain his current position in the bank he accepted it only with
reluctance  Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause
of concern for him he was no longer able to make use of his time in the
office anything like as well as he had previously he spent many hours
merely pretending to do important work but that only increased his
anxiety about not being in the office  Then he sometimes thought he saw
the deputy director who was always watching come into Ks office sit
at his desk look through his papers receive clients who had almost
become old friends of K and lure them away from him perhaps he even
discovered mistakes mistakes that seemed to threaten K from a thousand
directions when he was at work now and which he could no longer avoid
So now if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even
needed to make a short business trip however much an honour it seemed 
and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently
 there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of his
office for a while and check his work or at least the idea that they
thought he was dispensable  It would not have been difficult for him to
turn down most of these jobs but he did not dare to do so because if
his fears had the slightest foundation turning the jobs down would have
been an acknowledgement of them  For this reason he never demurred
from accepting them and even when he was asked to go on a tiring
business trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in
the rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill just in order to
avoid the risk of not being asked to go  When with a raging headache
he arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen to
accompany the Italian business contact the following day  The
temptation for once to turn the job down was very great especially as
it had no direct connection with business but there was no denying that
social obligations towards this business contact were in themselves
important enough only not for K who knew quite well that he needed
some successes at work if he was to maintain his position there and
that if he failed in that it would not help him even if this Italian
somehow found him quite charming; he did not want to be removed from his
workplace for even one day as the fear of not being allowed back in was
too great he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it still
made him anxious  However in this case it was almost impossible to
think of an acceptable excuse his knowledge of Italian was not great
but still good enough; the deciding factor was that K had earlier known
a little about art history and this had become widely known around the
bank in extremely exaggerated form and that K had been a member of the
Society for the Preservation of City Monuments albeit only for business
reasons  It was said that this Italian was an art lover so the choice
of K to accompany him was a matter of course
        It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K in a foul temper
at the thought of the day ahead of him arrived early at seven oclock
in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor
would prevent him  He had spent half the night studying a book of
Italian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very
tired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had
spent far too much time sitting of late but he resisted the temptation
and sat down to his work  Unfortunately just then the servitor came in
and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief
clerk was already in his office; if he was then would he please be so
kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was
already there  Ill come straight away said K  He put a small
dictionary in his pocket took a guide to the citys tourist sites under
his arm that he had compiled for strangers and went through the deputy
directors office into that of the director  He was glad he had come
into the office so early and was able to be of service immediately
nobody could seriously have expected that of him  The deputy directors
office was of course still as empty as the middle of the night the
servitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success
As K entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep
armchairs where they had been sitting  The director gave him a friendly
smile he was clearly very glad that K was there he immediately
introduced him to the Italian who shook Ks hand vigorously and joked
that somebody was an early riser  K did not quite understand whom he
had in mind it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K a
little while to guess its meaning  He replied with a few bland phrases
which the Italian received once more with a laugh passing his hand
nervously and repeatedly over his bluegrey bushy moustache  This
moustache was obviously perfumed it was almost tempting to come close
to it and sniff  When they had all sat down and begun a light
preliminary conversation K was disconcerted to notice that he
understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said  When he
spoke very calmly he understood almost everything but that was very
infrequent mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be
enjoying himself so much his head shook  When he was talking in this
way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which
seemed to K to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director
not only understood but also spoke although K ought to have foreseen
this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the
director had also spent several years  Whatever the cause K realised
that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely
taken from him even his French was difficult to understand and his
moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered
some help in understanding what he said  K began to anticipate many
difficulties  he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said 
with the director there who could understand him so easily it would
have been pointless effort  and for the time being did no more than
scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the
armchair as he frequently pulled at his short sharply tailored jacket
and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to
try and depict something that K could not grasp even though he was
leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight   K had
nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between
the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt to his alarm
although fortunately in good time he once caught himself nearly getting
up turning round and leaving  Eventually the Italian looked at the
clock and jumped up  After taking his leave from the director he turned
to K pressing himself so close to him that K had to push his chair
back just so that he could move  The director had no doubt seen the
anxiety in Ks eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian
he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and
unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments
whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the
Italian said so that K could understand  K learned in this way that
the Italian first had a few business matters to settle that he
unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal that he certainly
did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city that he
would much rather  at least as long as K would agree it was entirely
his decision   just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly  He was
extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and so
pleasant  by this he meant K who was occupied not with listening to
the Italian but the director  and asked if he would be so kind if the
time was suitable to meet him in the cathedral in two hours time at
about ten oclock  He hoped he would certainly be able to be there at
that time  K made an appropriate reply the Italian shook first the
directors hand and then Ks then the directors again and went to the
door half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk
without a break  K remained together with the director for a short
while although the director looked especially unhappy today  He
thought he needed to apologise to K for something and told him  they
were standing intimately close together  he had thought at first he
would accompany the Italian himself but then  he gave no more precise
reason than this  then he decided it would be better to send K with
him  He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italian
at first he would be able to very soon and even if he really could not
understand very much he said it was not so bad as it was really not so
important for the Italian to be understood  And anyway Ks knowledge
of Italian was surprisingly good the director was sure he would get by
very well  And with that it was time for K to go  He spent the time
still remaining to him with a dictionary copying out obscure words he
would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral  It was an
extremely irksome task servitors brought him the mail bank staff came
with various queries and when they saw that K was busy stood by the
door and did not go away until he had listened to them the deputy
director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K and came in
frequently took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its
pages clearly for no purpose when the door to the anteroom opened
even clients would appear from the  half darkness and bow timidly to him
 they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had
seen them  all this activity was circling around K with him at its
centre while he compiled the list of words he would need then looked
them up in the dictionary then wrote them out then practised their
pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart  The good
intentions he had had earlier though seemed to have left him
completely it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and
sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary
under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation but then
he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the
Italian without saying a word so in an even greater rage he
pulled the dictionary back out again
        At exactly half past nine just when he was about to leave there
was a telephone call for him Leni wished him good morning and asked how
he was K thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him
to talk now as he had to go to the cathedral To the cathedral? preguntó
Leni  Yes to the cathedral  What do you have to go to the
cathedral for? said Leni  K tried to explain it to her briefly but
he had hardly begun when Leni suddenly said Theyre harassing you
One thing that K could not bear was pity that he had not wanted or
expected he took his leave of her with two words but as he put the
receiver back in its place he said half to himself and half to the girl
on the other end of the line who could no longer hear him Yes theyre
acosándome
        By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would
not be on time  He took a taxi to the cathedral at the last moment he
had remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the
Italian earlier and so took it with him now  He held it on his knees
and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey  The rain had
eased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark it would be
difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold
flagstones might well make Ks chill much worse  The square in front
of the cathedral was quite empty K remembered how even as a small
child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square
had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time although
today with the weather like this it was more understandable  The
cathedral also seemed quite empty of course noone would think of going
there on a day like this  K hurried along both the side naves but saw
noone but an old woman who wrapped up in a warm shawl was kneeling at
a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it  Then in the
distance he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway in
the wall  K had arrived on time it had struck ten just as he was
entering the building but the Italian still was not there  K went
back to the main entrance stood there indecisively for a while and
then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was
waiting at another entrance  He was nowhere to be found  Could the
director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on?  How could
anyone understand someone like that properly anyway?  Whatever had
happened K would have to wait for him for at least half an hour  As
he was tired he wanted to sit down he went back inside the cathedral
he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps he moved it
with his foot to a nearby pew wrapped himself up tighter in his coat
put the collar up and sat down  To pass the time he opened the album
and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it
became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything
in the side nave next to him
        In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering
on the main altar K was not certain whether he had seen them earlier
Perhaps they had only just been lit  Church staff creep silently as
part of their job you dont notice them  When K happened to turn
round he also saw a tall stout candle attached to a column not far
behind him  It was all very pretty but totally inadequate to
illuminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the
side altars and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper  It was
discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him
there would have been nothing to see they would have had to content
themselves with seeking out a few pictures with Ks electric pocket
torch and looking at them one small part at a time  K went over to a
nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for he went up a
few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar
picture by the light of his torch  The eternal light hung disturbingly
in front of it  The first thing that K partly saw and partly guessed
at was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the
painting  He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked
ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and
there  He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was
being played out in front of him  It was astonishing to see how he
stood there without going any closer  Perhaps it was his job to stand
guard  It was a long time since K had looked at any pictures and he
studied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to
blink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch
Then when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found
an interment of Christ shown in the usual way it was also a
comparatively new painting  He put his torch away and went back to his
lugar
        There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer
but outside it was certainly raining heavily and as it was not so cold
in the cathedral as K had expected he decided to stay there for the
time being  Close by him was the great pulpit there were two plain
golden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost
flat and whose tips crossed over each other  The outside of the
pulpits balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to
the column supporting it little angels could be seen among the leaves
some of them lively and some of them still  K walked up to the pulpit
and examined it from all sides its stonework had been sculpted with
great care it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness
between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner K lay his
hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone until then he
had been totally unaware of this pulpits existence  Then K happened
to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews
he wore a loose creased black cassock he held a snuff box in his left
hand and he was watching K  Now what does he want? thought K  Do I
seem suspicious to him?  Does he want a tip?  But when the man in the
cassock saw that K had noticed him he raised his right hand a pinch of
snuff still held between two fingers and pointed in some vague
direction  It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour
meant K waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop
gesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head  Now
what does he want? asked K quietly he did not dare call out loud
here; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the
nearest pews to reach the man  He however immediately gestured to
turn down this offer shrugged his shoulders and limped away  As a
child K had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement
as this limp  This old man is like a child thought K he doesnt
have the sense for anything more than serving in a church  Look at the
way he stops when I stop and how he waits to see whether Ill
continue  With a smile K followed the old man all the way up the
side nave and almost as far as the main altar all this time the old man
continued to point at something but K deliberately avoided looking
round he was only pointing in order to make it harder for K to follow
him  Eventually K did stop following he did not want to worry the
old man too much and he also did not want to frighten him away
completely in case the Italian turned up after all
        When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left
the album he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next
to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat  It was very simple
made of plain white stone and so small that from a distance it looked
like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been  It
certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step
back from the balustrade and although there was no decoration on it
the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of
average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain
bent forward over the balustrade  In all it looked as if it had been
intended to make the priest suffer it was impossible to understand why
this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available
which were large and so artistically decorated
        And K would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if
there had not been a lamp fastened above it which usually meant there
was a sermon about to be given  So was a sermon to be given now? En
this empty church?  K looked down at the steps which pressed close
against the column led up to the pulpit  They were so narrow they
seemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to
use  But under the pulpit  K grinned in astonishment  there really
was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the
steps and looking at K  Then he nodded very slightly so that K
crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier  With a
little swing the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps
Was there really a sermon about to begin?  Maybe the man in the cassock
had not been really so demented and had meant to lead Ks way to the
preacher which in this empty church would have been very necessary
And there was also somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary
an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon  And if there was
to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ?  But the
organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of
its great height
        K now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible
if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the
sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted he had
lost so much time when he should have been in his office there had long
been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer he looked at
his watch it was eleven  But could there really be a sermon given?
Could K constitute the entire congregation?  How could he when he was
just a stranger who wanted to look at the church?  That basically was
all he was  The idea of a sermon now at eleven oclock on a workday
in hideous weather was nonsense  The priest  there was no doubt that
he was a priest a young man with a smooth dark face  was clearly
going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by
Error
        But there had been no mistake the priest seemed rather to check
that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher then he slowly
turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its
angular rail with both hands  He stood there like that for a while and
without turning his head looked around  K had moved back a long way
and leant his elbows on the front pew  Somewhere in the church  he
could not have said exactly where  he could make out the man in the
cassock hunched under his bent back and at peace as if his work were
completed  In the cathedral it was now very quiet  But K would have
to disturb that silence he had no intention of staying there; si era
the priests duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the
circumstances then he could and he could do it without Ks taking
part and Ks presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it
So K began slowly to move felt his way on tiptoe along the pew
arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed
except for the sound of his steps however light which rang out on the
stone floor and resounded from the vaulting quiet but continuous at a
repeating regular pace  K felt slightly abandoned as probably
observed by the priest he walked by himself between the empty pews and
the size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man
could bear  When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did
not hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and
took it with him  He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was
close to the  empty space between himself and the exit when for the
first time he heard the voice of the priest  A powerful and
experienced voice  It pierced through the reaches of the cathedral
ready waiting for it  But the priest was not calling out to the
congregation his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape from
it he called Josef K
        K stood still and looked down at the floor  In theory he was
still free he could have carried on walking through one of three dark
little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there  It
would simply mean he had not understood or that he had understood but
chose not to pay attention to it  But if he once turned round he would
be trapped then he would have acknowledged that he had understood
perfectly well that he really was the Josef K the priest had called to
and that he was willing to follow  If the priest had called out again
K would certainly have carried on out the door but everything was
silent as K also waited he turned his head slightly as he wanted to
see what the priest was doing now  He was merely standing in the pulpit
as before but it was obvious that he had seen K turn his head  If K
did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child
playing hide and seek  He did so and the priest beckoned him with his
finger  As everything could now be done openly he ran  because of
curiosity and the wish to get it over with  with long flying leaps
towards the pulpit  At the front pews he stopped but to the priest he
still seemed too far away he reached out his hand and pointed sharply
down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit  And
K did as he was told standing in that place he had to bend his head a
long way back just to see the priest  You are Josef K said the
priest and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose
meaning was unclear  Yes said K he considered how freely he had
always given his name in the past for some time now it had been a
burden to him now there were people who knew his name whom he had never
seen before it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only
then for people to know who you were  You have been accused said the
priest especially gently  Yes said K so I have been informed
Then you are the one I am looking for said the priest  I am the
prison chaplain  I see said K  I had you summoned here said the
priest because I wanted to speak to you  I knew nothing of that
said K  I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from Italy
That is beside the point said the priest  What are you holding in
your hand?  Is it a prayer book?  No answered K its an album of
the citys tourist sights  Put it down said the priest  K threw
it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the
floor tearing its pages  Do you know your case is going badly? preguntó
the priest  Thats how it seems to me too said K  Ive expended a
lot of effort on it but so far with no result  Although I do still
have some documents to submit  How do you imagine it will end? preguntó
the priest  At first I thought it was bound to end well said K
but now I have my doubts about it  I dont know how it will end  Do
you know?  I dont said the priest but I fear it will end badly
You are considered guilty  Your case will probably not even go beyond a
minor court  Provisionally at least your guilt is seen as proven
But Im not guilty said K theres been a mistake  How is it even
possible for someone to be guilty  Were all human beings here one
like the other  That is true said the priest but that is how the
guilty speak  Do you presume Im guilty too? asked K  I make no
presumptions about you said the priest  I thank you for that said
K but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something
against me and presumes Im guilty  They even influence those who
arent involved  My position gets harder all the time  You dont
understand the facts said the priest the verdict does not come
suddenly proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually
I see said K lowering his head  What do you intend to do about
your case next? asked the priest  I still need to find help said
K raising his head to see what the priest thought of this  There are
still certain possibilities I havent yet made use of  You look for
too much help from people you dont know said the priest
disapprovingly and especially from women  Can you really not see
thats not the help you need?  Sometimes in fact quite often I could
believe youre right said K but not always  Women have a lot of
power  If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together
with me then I would be certain to succeed  Especially in a court like
this that seems to consist of nothing but womanchasers  Show the
examining judge a woman in the distance and hell run right over the
desk and the accused just to get to her as soon as he can  The
priest lowered his head down to the balustrade only now did the roof
over the pulpit seem to press him down  What sort of dreadful weather
could it be outside?  It was no longer just a dull day it was deepest
night  None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker
of light on the darkness of the walls  And this was the moment when the
man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar one
by one  Are you cross with me? asked K  Maybe you dont know what
sort of court it is you serve  He received no answer  Well its
just my own experience said K  Above him there was still silence  I
didnt mean to insult you said K  At that the priest screamed down
at K:  Can you not see two steps in front of you?  He shouted in
anger but it was also the scream of one who sees another fall and
shocked and without thinking screams against his own will
        The two men then remained silent for a long time  In the
darkness beneath him the priest could not possibly have seen K
distinctly although K was able to see him clearly by the light of the
little lamp  Why did the priest not come down?  He had not given a
sermon he had only told K a few things which if he followed them
closely would probably cause him more harm than good  But the priest
certainly seemed to mean well it might even be possible if he would
come down and cooperate with him it might even be possible for him to
obtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the
difference it might for instance be able to show him not so much to
influence the proceedings but how to break free of them how to evade
them how to live away from them  K had to admit that this was
something he had had on his mind quite a lot of late  If the priest
knew of such a possibility he might if K asked him let him know about
it even though he was part of the court himself and even though when
K had criticised the court he had held down his gentle nature and
actually shouted at K
        Would you not like to come down here? asked K  If youre not
going to give a sermon come down here with me  Now I can come down
said the priest perhaps he regretted having shouted at K  As he took
down the lamp from its hook he said to start off with I had to speak
to you from a distance  Otherwise Im too easily influenced and forget
mi deber
        K waited for him at the foot of the steps  While he was still on
one of the higher steps as he  came down them the priest reached out his
hand for K to shake  Can you spare me a little of your time? preguntó
K  As much time as you need said the priest and passed him the
little lamp for him to carry  Even at close distance the priest did not
lose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character  You
are very friendly towards me said K as they walked up and down
beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves  That makes
you an exception among all those who belong to the court  I can trust
you more than any of the others Ive seen  I can speak openly with
you  Dont fool yourself said the priest  How would I be fooling
myself? asked K  You fool yourself in the court said the priest
it talks about this selfdeceit in the opening paragraphs to the law
In front of the law there is a doorkeeper  A man from the countryside
comes up to the door and asks for entry  But the doorkeeper says he
cant let him in to the law right now  The man thinks about this and
then he asks if hell be able to go in later on  Thats possible
says the doorkeeper but not now  The gateway to the law is open as
it always is and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side so the man
bends over to try and see in  When the doorkeeper notices this he
laughs and says If youre tempted give it a try try and go in even
though I say you cant  Careful though: Im powerful  And Im only the
lowliest of all the doormen  But theres a doorkeeper for each of the
rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last  Its more than I
can stand just to look at the third one  The man from the country had
not expected difficulties like this the law was supposed to be
accessible for anyone at any time he thinks but now he looks more
closely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat sees his big hooked nose his
long thin tartarbeard and he decides its better to wait until he has
permission to enter  The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit
down to one side of the gate  He sits there for days and years  He
tries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his
requests  The doorkeeper often questions him asking about where hes
from and many other things but these are disinterested questions such
as great men ask and he always ends up by telling him he still cant
let him in  The man had come well equipped for his journey and uses
everything however valuable to bribe the doorkeeper  He accepts
everything but as he does so he says Ill only accept this so that
you dont think theres anything youve failed to do  Over many years
the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break  He forgets about
the other doormen and begins to think this one is the only thing
stopping him from gaining access to the law Over the first few years he
curses his unhappy condition out loud but later as he becomes old he
just grumbles to himself  He becomes senile and as he has come to know
even the fleas in the doorkeepers fur collar over the years that he has
been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the
doorkeepers mind  Finally his eyes grow dim and he no longer knows
whether its really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving
him  But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine
from the darkness behind the door  He doesnt have long to live now
Just before he dies he brings together all his experience from all this
time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper
He beckons to him as hes no longer able to raise his stiff body  The
doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has
changed very much to the disadvantage of the man  What is it you want
to know now? asks the doorkeeper Youre insatiable  Everyone wants
access to the law says the man how come over all these years no
one but me has asked to be let in?  The doorkeeper can see the mans
come to his end his hearing has faded and so so that he can be heard
he shouts to him: Nobody else could have got in this way as this
entrance was meant only for you  Now Ill go and close it
        So the doorkeeper cheated the man said K immediately who had
been captivated by the story  Dont be too quick said the priest
dont take somebody elses opinion without checking it  I told you the
story exactly as it was written  Theres nothing in there about
cheating  But its quite clear said K and your first
interpretation of it was quite correct  The doorkeeper gave him the
information that would release him only when it could be of no more
use  He didnt ask him before that said the priest and dont
forget he was only a doorkeeper and as doorkeeper he did his duty
What makes you think he did his duty? asked K He didnt  It might
have been his duty to keep everyone else away but this man is who the
door was intended for and he ought to have let him in  Youre not
paying enough attention to what was written and youre changing the
story said the priest  According to the story there are two
important things that the doorkeeper explains about access to the law
one at the beginning one at the end  At one place he says he cant
allow him in now and at the other he says this entrance was intended
for him alone  If one of the statements contradicted the other you
would be right and the doorkeeper would have cheated the man from the
country  But there is no contradiction  On the contrary the first
statement even hints at the second  You could almost say the doorkeeper
went beyond his duty in that he offered the man some prospect of being
admitted in the future  Throughout the story his duty seems to have
been merely to turn the man away and there are many commentators who
are surprised that the doorkeeper offered this hint at all as he seems
to love exactitude and keeps strict guard over his position  He stays
at his post for many years and doesnt close the gate until the very
end hes very conscious of the importance of his service as he says
Im powerful he has respect for his superiors as he says Im only
the lowliest of the doormen hes not talkative as through all these
years the only questions he asks are disinterested hes not
corruptible as when hes offered a gift he says Ill only accept this
so that you dont think theres anything youve failed to do as far as
fulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged as it
says about the man that he tires the doorkeeper with his requests
even his external appearance suggests a pedantic character the big
hooked nose and the long thin black tartarbeard  How could any
doorkeeper be more faithful to his duty?  But in the doorkeepers
character there are also other features which might be very useful for
those who seek entry to the law and when he hinted at some possibility
in the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go
beyond his duty  Theres no denying hes a little simple minded and
that makes him a little conceited  Even if all he said about his power
and the power of the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear
the sight of them  I say even if all these assertions are right the
way he makes them shows that hes too simple and arrogant to understand
properly  The commentators say about this that correct understanding
of a matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually
exclusive  Whether theyre right or not you have to concede that his
simplicity and arrogance however little they show do weaken his
function of guarding the entrance they are defects in the doorkeepers
character  You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be
friendly by nature he isnt always just an official  He makes a joke
right at the beginning in that he invites the man to enter at the same
time as maintaining the ban on his entering and then he doesnt send
him away but gives him as it says in the text a stool to sit on and
lets him stay by the side of the door  The patience with which he puts
up with the mans requests through all these years the little
questioning sessions accepting the gifts his politeness when he puts
up with the man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who
caused that fate  all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy
Not every doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way  And finally
he lets the man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can
put his last question  Theres no more than some slight impatience 
the doorkeeper knows everythings come to its end  shown in the words
Youre insatiable  There are many commentators who go even further in
explaining it in this way and think the words youre insatiable are
an expression of friendly admiration albeit with some condescension
However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out
differently from how you might think  You know the story better than
I do and youve known it for longer said K  They were silent for a
while  And then K said So you think the man was not cheated do
you?  Dont get me wrong said the priest Im just pointing out the
different opinions about it  You shouldnt pay too much attention to
peoples opinions  The text cannot be altered and the various opinions
are often no more than an expression of despair over it  Theres even
one opinion which says its the doorkeeper whos been cheated  That
does seem to take things too far said K  How can they argue the
doorkeeper has been cheated?  Their argument answered the priest
is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper  They say the doorkeeper
doesnt know the inside of the law only the way into it where he just
walks up and down  They see his ideas of whats inside the law as
rather childish and suppose hes afraid himself of what he wants to
make the man frightened of  Yes hes more afraid of it than the man
as the man wants nothing but to go inside the law even after hes heard
about the terrible doormen there in contrast to the doorkeeper who
doesnt want to go in or at least we dont hear anything about it  On
the other hand there are those who say he must have already been inside
the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only
have been done inside  That can be countered by supposing he could have
been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside
and that he cant have gone very far inside as he couldnt bear the
sight of the third doorkeeper  Nor through all those years does the
story say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside other
than his comment about the other doorkeepers  He could have been
forbidden to do so but he hasnt said anything about that either  All
this seems to show he doesnt know anything about what the inside looks
like or what it means and that thats why hes being deceived  But
hes also being deceived by the man from the country as hes this mans
subordinate and doesnt know it  Theres a lot to indicate that he
treats the man as his subordinate I expect you remember but those who
hold this view would say its very clear that he really is his
subordinate   Above all the free man is superior to the man who has to
serve another  Now the man really is free he can go wherever he
wants the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and whats
more theres only one man forbidding him to do so  the doorkeeper  If
he takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his
life he does this of his own free will theres nothing in the story to
say he was forced to do it  On the other hand the doorkeeper is kept
to his post by his employment hes not allowed to go away from it and
it seems hes not allowed to go inside either not even if he wanted to
Also although hes in the service of the law hes only there for this
one entrance therefore hes there only in the service of this one man
who the doors intended for  This is another way in which hes his
subordinate  We can take it that hes been performing this somewhat
empty service for many years through the whole of a mans life as it
says that a man will come that means someone old enough to be a man
That means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his
function is fulfilled he will have to wait for as long as the man
liked who came to the door of his own free will  Even the end of the
doorkeepers service is determined by when the mans life ends so the
doorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end  And its pointed
out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of this
although this is not seen as anything remarkable as those who hold this
view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way thats far worse a way
thats to do with his service  At the end speaking about the entrance
he says Now Ill go and close it although at the beginning of the
story it says the door to the law is open as it always is but if its
always open  always  that means its open independently of the
lifespan of the man its intended for and not even the doorkeeper will
be able to close it  There are various opinions about this some say
the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to
duty or just when the man was in his last moments the doorkeeper
wanted to cause him regret and sorrow  There are many who agree that he
wouldnt be able to close the door  They even believe at the end at
least the doorkeeper is aware deep down that hes the mans
subordinate as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to
the law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and
says nothing at all to show theres been any change  That is well
substantiated said K who had been repeating some parts of the
priests explanation to himself in a whisper  It is well
substantiated and now I too think the doorkeeper must have been
deceived  Although that does not mean Ive abandoned what I thought
earlier as the two versions are to some extent not incompatible Its
not clear whether the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived  I said
the man had been cheated  If the doorkeeper understands clearly then
there could be some doubt about it but if the doorkeeper has been
deceived then the man is bound to believe the same thing  That would
mean the doorkeeper is not a cheat but so simpleminded that he ought to
be dismissed from his job immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it
will do him no harm but the man will be harmed immensely  There
youve found another opinion said the priest as there are many who
say the story doesnt give anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper
However he might seem to us he is still in the service of the law so he
belongs to the law so hes beyond what man has a right to judge  In
this case we cant believe the doorkeeper is the mans subordinate
Even if he has to stay at the entrance into the law his service makes
him incomparably more than if he lived freely in the world  The man has
come to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is already there
Hes been given his position by the law to doubt his worth would be to
doubt the law  I cant say Im in complete agreement with this view
said K shaking his head as if you accept it youll have to accept
that everything said by the doorkeeper is true  But youve already
explained very fully that thats not possible  No said the priest
you dont need to accept everything as true you only have to accept it
as necessary  Depressing view said K  The lie made into the rule
del mundo
        K said that as if it were his final word but it was not his
conclusion  He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of
the story and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar
to him unrealistic things things better suited for officials of the
court to discuss than for him  The simple story had lost its shape he
wanted to shake it off and the priest who now felt quite compassionate
allowed this and accepted Ks remarks without comment even though his
view was certainly very different from Ks
        In silence they carried on walking for some time K stayed close
beside the priest without knowing where he was  The lamp in his hand
had long since gone out  Once just in front of him he thought he
could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it
although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness  So that he
would not remain entirely dependent on the priest K asked him Were
now near the main entrance are we?  No said the priest were a
long way from it  Do you already want to go?  K had not thought of
going until then but he immediately said
Yes certainly I have to go  Im the chief clerk in a bank and there
are people waiting for me I only came here to show a foreign business
contact round the cathedral  Alright said the priest offering him
his hand go then  But I cant find my way round in this darkness by
myself said K  Go to your left as far as the wall said the priest
then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and youll find a
way out  The priest had only gone a few paces from him but K was
already shouting loudly Please wait  Im waiting said the
priest  Is there anything else you want from me? asked K  No said
the priest  You were so friendly to me earlier on said K and you
explained everything but now you abandon me as if I were nothing to
you  You have to go said the priest
Well yes said K you need to understand that  First you need
to understand who I am said the priest  Youre the prison chaplain
said K and went closer to the priest it was not so important for him
to go straight back to the bank as he had made out he could very well
stay where he was  So that means I belong to the court said the
priest  So why would I want anything from you?  the court doesnt want
anything from you  It accepts you when you come and it lets you go when
te vas
Chapter Ten
End
        The evening before Ks thirtyfirst birthday  it was about nine
oclock in the evening the time when the streets were quiet  two men
came to where he lived  In frock coats pale and fat wearing top hats
that looked like they could not be taken off their heads  After some
brief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived the
same formalities were repeated at greater length at Ks door  He had
not been notified they would be coming but K sat in a chair near the
door dressed in black as they were and slowly put on new gloves which
stretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting
visitors  He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen
inquisitively  Youve come for me then have you? he asked  The
gentlemen nodded one of them indicated the other with the top hand now
in his hand  K told them he had been expecting a different visitor
He went to the window and looked once more down at the dark street
Most of the windows on the other side of the street were also dark
already many of them had the curtains closed  In one of the windows on
the same floor where there was a light on two small children could be
seen playing with each other inside a playpen unable to move from where
they were reaching out for each other with their little hands  Some
ancient unimportant actors  thats what theyve sent for me said K
to himself and looked round once again to confirm this to himself
They want to sort me out as cheaply as they can  K suddenly turned
round to face the two men and asked What theatre do you play in?
Theatre? asked one of the gentlemen turning to the other for
assistance and pulling in the corners of his mouth  The other made a
gesture like someone who was dumb as if he were struggling with some
organism causing him trouble  Youre not properly prepared to answer
questions said K and went to fetch his hat
        As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take
Ks arms but K said Wait till were in the street Im not ill
But they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a
way that K had never experienced before   They kept their shoulders
close behind his did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the
entire length of Ks arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that
was formal experienced and could not be resisted  K was held stiff
and upright between them they formed now a single unit so that if any
one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen  They
formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter
that is lifeless
        Whenever they passed under a lamp K tried to see his companions
more clearly as far as was possible when they were pressed so close
together as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible
Maybe theyre tenors he thought as he saw their big double chins
The cleanliness of their faces disgusted him  He could see the hands
that cleaned them passing over the corners of their eyes rubbing at
their upper lips scratching out the creases on those chins
        When K noticed that he stopped which meant the others had to
stop too; they were at the edge of an open square devoid of people but
decorated with flower beds  Why did they send you of all people he
cried out more a shout than a question  The two gentleman clearly knew
no answer to give they waited their free arms hanging down like
nurses when the patient needs to rest  I will go no further said K
as if to see what would happen  The gentlemen did not need to make any
answer it was enough that they did not loosen their grip on K and
tried to move him on but K resisted them  Ill soon have no need of
much strength Ill use all of it now he thought   He thought of the
flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper
These gentleman will have some hard work to do
        Just then Miss Bürstner came up into the square in front of them
from the steps leading from a small street at a lower level  It was not
certain that it was her although the similarity was of course great
But it did not matter to K whether it was certainly her anyway he just
became suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance  There
would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted if he now caused
trouble for these gentlemen if in defending himself he sought to enjoy
his last glimmer of life  He started walking which pleased the
gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him  Now they
permitted him to decide which direction they took and he decided to
take the direction that followed the young woman in front of them not
so much because he wanted to catch up with her nor even because he
wanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible but only so that he
would not forget the reproach she represented for him   The only thing
I can do now he said to himself and his thought was confirmed by the
equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others the
only thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do whats needed
right till the end  I always wanted to go at the world and try and do
too much and even to do it for something that was not too cheap  That
was wrong of me  Should I now show them I learned nothing from facing
trial for a year?  Should I go out like someone stupid?  Should I let
anyone say after Im gone that at the start of the proceedings I
wanted to end them and that now that theyve ended I want to start them
again?  I dont want anyone to say that  Im grateful they sent these
unspeaking uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey and that
its been left up to me to say whats necessary
        Meanwhile the young woman had turned off into a side street but
K could do without her now and let his companions lead him  All three
of them now in complete agreement went over a bridge in the light of
the moon the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little
movement made by K as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed
the group in that direction as a single unit  The moonlight glittered
and quivered in the water which divided itself around a small island
covered in a denselypiled mass of foliage and trees and bushes
Beneath them now invisible there were gravel paths with comfortable
benches where K had stretched himself out on many summers days  I
didnt actually want to stop here he said to his companions shamed by
their compliance with his wishes  Behind Ks back one of them seemed
to quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping
and then they went on  They went on up through several streets where
policemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distance
and then some very close   One of them with a bushy moustache his hand
on the  grip of his sword seemed to have some purpose in approaching
the group which was hardly unsuspicious  The two gentlemen stopped
the policeman seemed about to open his mouth and then K drove his
group forcefully forward  Several times he looked back cautiously to
see if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between
themselves and the policeman K began to run and the two gentlemen
despite being seriously short of breath had to run with him
        In this way they quickly left the built up area and found
themselves in the fields which in this part of town began almost
without any transition zone   There was a quarry empty and abandoned
near a building which was still like those in the city  Here the men
stopped perhaps because this had always been their destination or
perhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further  Here they
released their hold on K who just waited in silence and took their
top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off
their brows with their handkerchiefs  The moonlight lay everywhere with
the natural peace that is granted to no other light
        After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the
next tasks  the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific
functions  one of them went to K and took his coat his waistcoat and
finally his shirt off him  K made an involuntary shiver at which the
gentleman gave him a gentle reassuring tap on the back  Then he
carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed even if
not in the near future  He did not want to expose K to the chilly
night air without moving though so he took him under the arm and walked
up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round
the quarry for a suitable place  When he had found it he made a sign
and the other gentleman escorted him there  It was near the rockface
there was a stone lying there that had broken loose  The gentlemen sat
K down on the ground leant him against the stone and settled his head
down on the top of it  Despite all the effort they went to and despite
all the cooperation shown by K his demeanour seemed very forced and
hard to believe  So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a
short time while he put K in position by himself but even that did
nothing to make it better  In the end they left K in a position that
was far from the best of the ones they had tried so far  Then one of
the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a belt
stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long thin doubleedged
butchers knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness
The repulsive courtesies began once again one of them passed the knife
over K to the other who then passed it back over K to the first  K
now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand
to hand above him and thrust it into himself  But he did not do it
instead he twisted his neck which was still free and looked around
He was not able to show his full worth was not able to take all the
work from the official bodies he lacked the rest of the strength he
needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it
to him  As he looked round he saw the top floor of the building next
to the quarry  He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a
window opened out somebody made weak and thin by the height and the
distance leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even
further  Who was that?  A friend?  A good person?  Somebody who was
taking part?  Somebody who wanted to help?  Was he alone?  Was it
everyone?  Would anyone help?  Were there objections that had been
forgotten?  There must have been some  The logic cannot be refuted but
someone who wants to live will not resist it  Where was the judge hed
never seen?  Where was the high court he had never reached?  He raised
both hands and spread out all his fingers
        But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on Ks throat
while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it
there twice  As his eyesight failed K saw the two gentlemen cheek by
cheek close in front of his face watching the result Like a dog he
said it was as if the shame of it should outlive him
